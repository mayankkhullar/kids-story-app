    content: `Once upon a time, there lived a kind girl named Ella who worked hard every day.

Her stepsisters were mean to her, making her do all the chores. But Ella never complained.

"One day, things will be better," she would say with hope.

One evening, an invitation arrived. The prince was hosting a grand ball!

"You can't go!" laughed her stepsisters. "You have nothing to wear!"

Ella sat crying in the garden when suddenly, sparkles filled the air!

A kind fairy appeared. "Don't cry, dear child. You SHALL go to the ball!"

With a wave of her wand, Ella's rags became a beautiful gown. Glass slippers appeared on her feet!

"Be home by midnight," warned the fairy, "for the magic will end."

At the ball, everyone gasped at the beautiful stranger. The prince asked her to dance.

They danced and talked all night. Ella had never been so happy!

BONG! The clock struck midnight!

"I must go!" Ella ran down the stairs, losing one glass slipper.

The prince found the slipper. "I will find her," he vowed.

He searched the whole kingdom. Finally, he reached Ella's house.

The stepsisters tried, but the slipper didn't fit. Then Ella stepped forward.

The slipper fit perfectly!

"It's you!" The prince was overjoyed.

Ella forgave her stepsisters, for her heart was full of kindness.

She and the prince lived happily ever after.`,

They invited all the fairies to bless her. But they forgot one fairy!

The angry fairy cursed Aurora. "Before her 16th birthday, she will prick her finger and sleep forever!"

A kind fairy softened the curse. "Not forever. True love's kiss will wake her."

The king burned all the spinning wheels in the kingdom.

Aurora grew up kind and beautiful. Everyone loved her.

On her 16th birthday, she found a hidden room with an old spinning wheel.

"How pretty!" She touched it and pricked her finger.

Aurora fell into a deep sleep. The whole kingdom fell asleep with her!

Thorns grew around the castle. Years passed.

One day, a brave prince heard the story of the sleeping princess.

He cut through the thorns and found Aurora sleeping peacefully.

"She's so beautiful," he whispered.

He gently kissed her forehead.

Aurora's eyes opened! She smiled at the prince.

She had beautiful red hair and the most lovely singing voice.

Marina was curious about the world above the waves.

"What's it like up there?" she would ask, gazing at the surface.

One stormy night, she saved a prince whose ship had sunk.

She brought him safely to shore and sang to him as he woke.

"Who are you?" he asked, but Marina had already slipped back into the sea.

The prince never forgot her beautiful voice.

Marina went to the sea witch. "I want to be human!"

"I'll give you legs," said the witch, "but it will cost your voice."

Marina agreed. She wanted to see the human world so badly!

She walked on land but couldn't speak or sing.

The prince found her on the beach. "You seem so familiar..."

Marina couldn't tell him who she was. But she showed him kindness every day.

They became good friends. Marina showed him the beauty in simple things.

One day, Marina was in danger. She tried to warn the prince but had no voice.

Just then, her mermaid sisters appeared with a magic shell!

They had traded their beautiful hair to the witch to save Marina's voice!

Marina sang, and the prince recognized her immediately!

"It was you all along!" He was overjoyed.

The sea king, touched by their love, gave Marina a choice to stay human.

Marina chose to live between both worlds, visiting her family in the sea and her prince on land.`,

The woman was actually a powerful fairy. She cursed him to become a beast!

"Only true love can break this spell," she said, leaving him a magic rose.

Years passed. The Beast lived alone in his castle, sad and angry.

One day, a merchant got lost and found the castle. He picked a rose for his daughter Belle.

"You stole my rose!" roared the Beast. "You must pay!"

Belle came to take her father's place. She was scared but brave.

At first, the Beast was grumpy and rude. Belle didn't like him at all.

But slowly, things changed.

The Beast showed Belle his library full of books. She loved to read!

He let the birds eat from his hands. He wasn't so scary after all.

Belle taught the Beast to be gentle. They read together, walked in the garden, and laughed.

"He's not a beast inside," Belle realized. "He has a good heart."

One day, Belle saw her sick father in a magic mirror. "I must go to him!"

The Beast let her go, even though it broke his heart.

Belle helped her father get better. But she missed the Beast terribly.

She rushed back to the castle and found the Beast very weak.

"You came back!" he whispered.

"I love you," Belle said, tears in her eyes.

Suddenly, magic swirled around the Beast. He transformed into a prince!

"Your love broke the spell," he said.

They lived happily ever after, and the prince was never selfish again.`,

When he rubbed it, WHOOSH! Out came a friendly genie!

"You freed me! I'll grant you three wishes!"

Ali thought carefully. He didn't wish for gold or palaces.

"I wish to help others," Ali said. "And to fly!"

The genie gave him a magic carpet that could soar through the sky!

Ali flew over the city, helping people in trouble.

He rescued a cat from a tall tree. He brought medicine to a sick grandmother.

The princess saw him flying and was amazed. "Who is that kind boy?"

She invited Ali to the palace. They became friends immediately.

"I don't care that you're not rich," said the princess. "You have a rich heart."

An evil wizard tried to steal Ali's lamp. "Give it to me!"

But Ali was clever. He tricked the wizard and saved the day!

The genie was so happy. "Ali, you never used your wishes selfishly."

"I have everything I need," Ali smiled. "Friends, adventure, and a good heart."

Elsa had a magical secret - she could create ice and snow!

Anna didn't understand. "Why won't my sister play with me?"

Years passed. The sisters grew apart. Elsa always wore gloves to hide her powers.

When Elsa became queen, she got scared and her powers burst out!

She ran away to the mountains and built a beautiful ice palace.

But she had accidentally frozen the whole kingdom!

Anna went to find her sister. "I know you didn't mean it!"

She climbed mountains and crossed frozen lakes.

"Go away, Anna! I don't want to hurt you!" cried Elsa.

"I'm not afraid of you," Anna said. "You're my sister and I love you."

But an accident happened - Elsa's ice struck Anna's heart!

Anna began to freeze. Only an act of true love could save her.

A prince tried to kiss her, but it didn't work. It wasn't true love.

Then Anna saw someone about to hurt Elsa!

With her last strength, Anna jumped in front of her sister.

She froze completely, saving Elsa.

Elsa hugged her frozen sister, crying. "I love you, Anna!"

And then - Anna thawed! The act of true love was Anna's sacrifice for her sister!

Simba couldn't wait to be king! He was playful and curious.

But Simba's uncle Scar was jealous. He wanted to be king himself.

One day, Scar tricked Simba into a dangerous canyon.

A stampede came! Mufasa saved Simba but fell from the cliff.

"It's your fault!" lied Scar. "Run away and never return!"

Simba ran far away, full of guilt and sadness.

He met two funny friends, a meerkat named Timon and a warthog named Pumbaa.

"Hakuna Matata!" they taught him. "It means no worries!"

Simba grew up happy but always felt something was missing.

One day, his childhood friend Nala found him. "Simba! The kingdom needs you!"

"I can't go back," Simba said sadly. "It's my fault my father died."

That night, Simba looked at the stars. He saw his father's face!

"You are my son, and the one true king," said Mufasa's spirit. "Remember who you are."

Simba knew what he had to do.

He returned home. The land was dry and sad under Scar's rule.

"I'm back!" announced Simba.

Scar tried to blame him, but the truth came out. Scar had caused Mufasa's death!

Simba defeated his uncle. Rain began to fall, and the land came back to life.

The puppet's eyes opened! He could move and talk!

"I am Pinocchio!" he said.

"Be good, brave, and truthful," said the fairy, "and one day you'll be a real boy."

She gave him a little cricket named Jiminy to be his conscience.

"Listen to your heart," said Jiminy. "I'll help you know right from wrong."

But Pinocchio didn't always listen. He skipped school to see a puppet show!

He told a lie, and his nose grew longer! He was so embarrassed.

"Lying makes your nose grow!" laughed Jiminy. "Tell the truth!"

Pinocchio was tricked by bad foxes who locked him in a cage.

"Help!" he cried. The blue fairy came. "What happened?"

Pinocchio started to lie, but his nose grew and grew!

"I'll tell the truth!" he said. His nose went back to normal.

The fairy freed him, but warned him to be good.

Then Pinocchio heard that Geppetto was in trouble! A whale had swallowed his boat!

Without thinking of himself, Pinocchio dove into the sea.

Inside the whale, he found his father! "Pinocchio! You came for me!"

They made a fire, and the whale sneezed them out!

Pinocchio saved Geppetto, but the cold water made him very weak.

Geppetto carried him home, crying. "My brave boy!"

She touched him with her wand. Pinocchio became a real boy!

Geppetto was the happiest father in the world.`,

एक शाम, एक निमंत्रण आया। राजकुमार एक भव्य नृत्य पार्टी दे रहा था!

"तुम नहीं जा सकती!" सौतेली बहनें हँसीं। "तुम्हारे पास पहनने को कुछ नहीं!"

एला बगीचे में रो रही थी जब अचानक चमक फैल गई!

एक दयालु परी प्रकट हुई। "रो मत बच्ची। तुम जरूर जाओगी!"

छड़ी हिलाते ही एला के पुराने कपड़े सुंदर गाउन बन गए। उसके पैरों में काँच की जूतियाँ आ गईं!

टन! आधी रात हो गई!

"मुझे जाना होगा!" एला भागी, एक जूती छूट गई।

राजकुमार ने जूती उठाई। "मैं उसे ढूंढूंगा।"

वह पूरे राज्य में खोजता रहा। अंत में एला के घर पहुँचा।

सौतेली बहनों ने कोशिश की, जूती नहीं आई। फिर एला आगे आई।

जूती एकदम फिट हुई!

एल्सा डर गई। "मैं फिर से चोट पहुँचा सकती हूँ!" वह अन्ना से दूर रहने लगी।

अन्ना समझ नहीं पाई। "मेरी बहन मेरे साथ क्यों नहीं खेलती?"

साल बीते। बहनें दूर हो गईं।

लेकिन एक दुर्घटना हुई - एल्सा की बर्फ अन्ना के दिल में लगी!

अन्ना जमने लगी। केवल सच्चा प्यार उसे बचा सकता था।

फिर अन्ना ने देखा कोई एल्सा को नुकसान पहुँचाने वाला था!

अपनी आखिरी ताकत से, अन्ना अपनी बहन के सामने कूद पड़ी।

एल्सा ने अपनी जमी बहन को गले लगाया, रोते हुए। "मैं तुमसे प्यार करती हूँ, अन्ना!"

ਉਸਦੀਆਂ ਮਤਰੇਈਆਂ ਭੈਣਾਂ ਉਸ ਨਾਲ ਬੁਰਾ ਸਲੂਕ ਕਰਦੀਆਂ ਸਨ। ਪਰ ਐਲਾ ਕਦੇ ਸ਼ਿਕਾਇਤ ਨਹੀਂ ਕਰਦੀ ਸੀ।

"ਇੱਕ ਦਿਨ ਸਭ ਠੀਕ ਹੋ ਜਾਵੇਗਾ," ਉਹ ਉਮੀਦ ਨਾਲ ਕਹਿੰਦੀ।

ਇੱਕ ਸ਼ਾਮ, ਇੱਕ ਸੱਦਾ ਆਇਆ। ਰਾਜਕੁਮਾਰ ਇੱਕ ਵੱਡੀ ਪਾਰਟੀ ਦੇ ਰਿਹਾ ਸੀ!

"ਤੂੰ ਨਹੀਂ ਜਾ ਸਕਦੀ!" ਭੈਣਾਂ ਹੱਸੀਆਂ। "ਤੇਰੇ ਕੋਲ ਪਾਉਣ ਨੂੰ ਕੁਝ ਨਹੀਂ!"

ਐਲਾ ਬਾਗ ਵਿੱਚ ਰੋ ਰਹੀ ਸੀ ਜਦੋਂ ਅਚਾਨਕ ਚਮਕ ਫੈਲ ਗਈ!

ਇੱਕ ਦਿਆਲੂ ਪਰੀ ਪ੍ਰਗਟ ਹੋਈ। "ਰੋ ਨਾ ਬੱਚੀ। ਤੂੰ ਜ਼ਰੂਰ ਜਾਵੇਂਗੀ!"

ਛੜੀ ਹਿਲਾਉਂਦੇ ਹੀ ਐਲਾ ਦੇ ਪੁਰਾਣੇ ਕੱਪੜੇ ਸੋਹਣੇ ਗਾਊਨ ਬਣ ਗਏ। ਉਸਦੇ ਪੈਰਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਕੱਚ ਦੀਆਂ ਜੁੱਤੀਆਂ ਆ ਗਈਆਂ!

"ਅੱਧੀ ਰਾਤ ਤੋਂ ਪਹਿਲਾਂ ਘਰ ਆ ਜਾਣਾ," ਪਰੀ ਨੇ ਚੇਤਾਵਨੀ ਦਿੱਤੀ।

ਪਾਰਟੀ ਵਿੱਚ ਸਭ ਨੇ ਉਸ ਸੋਹਣੀ ਅਜਨਬੀ ਨੂੰ ਦੇਖਿਆ। ਰਾਜਕੁਮਾਰ ਨੇ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਨੱਚਣ ਲਈ ਬੁਲਾਇਆ।

ਉਹ ਸਾਰੀ ਰਾਤ ਨੱਚੇ। ਐਲਾ ਬਹੁਤ ਖੁਸ਼ ਸੀ!

ਟਣ! ਅੱਧੀ ਰਾਤ ਹੋ ਗਈ!

"ਮੈਨੂੰ ਜਾਣਾ ਪਵੇਗਾ!" ਐਲਾ ਭੱਜੀ, ਇੱਕ ਜੁੱਤੀ ਛੁੱਟ ਗਈ।

ਰਾਜਕੁਮਾਰ ਨੇ ਜੁੱਤੀ ਚੁੱਕੀ। "ਮੈਂ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਲੱਭਾਂਗਾ।"

ਐਲਾ ਨੇ ਆਪਣੀਆਂ ਭੈਣਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਮਾਫ਼ ਕਰ ਦਿੱਤਾ, ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਉਸਦਾ ਦਿਲ ਦਿਆਲੂ ਸੀ।

ਉਹ ਸਾਰੇ ਖੁਸ਼ੀ ਨਾਲ ਰਹੇ।`,

    content: `ਪਹਾੜਾਂ ਦੇ ਇੱਕ ਰਾਜ ਵਿੱਚ ਦੋ ਰਾਜਕੁਮਾਰੀ ਭੈਣਾਂ ਰਹਿੰਦੀਆਂ ਸਨ, ਐਲਸਾ ਤੇ ਅੰਨਾ।

ਐਲਸਾ ਕੋਲ ਜਾਦੂਈ ਸ਼ਕਤੀ ਸੀ - ਉਹ ਬਰਫ਼ ਬਣਾ ਸਕਦੀ ਸੀ!

ਪਰ ਇੱਕ ਦਿਨ, ਉਸਨੇ ਗਲਤੀ ਨਾਲ ਅੰਨਾ ਨੂੰ ਸੱਟ ਮਾਰ ਦਿੱਤੀ।

ਐਲਸਾ ਡਰ ਗਈ। "ਮੈਂ ਫਿਰ ਸੱਟ ਮਾਰ ਸਕਦੀ ਹਾਂ!" ਉਹ ਅੰਨਾ ਤੋਂ ਦੂਰ ਰਹਿਣ ਲੱਗੀ।

ਅੰਨਾ ਸਮਝ ਨਾ ਸਕੀ। "ਮੇਰੀ ਭੈਣ ਮੇਰੇ ਨਾਲ ਕਿਉਂ ਨਹੀਂ ਖੇਡਦੀ?"

ਸਾਲ ਬੀਤੇ। ਭੈਣਾਂ ਦੂਰ ਹੋ ਗਈਆਂ।

ਜਦੋਂ ਐਲਸਾ ਰਾਣੀ ਬਣੀ, ਉਹ ਡਰ ਗਈ ਤੇ ਉਸਦੀਆਂ ਸ਼ਕਤੀਆਂ ਫੁੱਟ ਪਈਆਂ!

ਉਸਨੇ ਗਲਤੀ ਨਾਲ ਪੂਰਾ ਰਾਜ ਜਮਾ ਦਿੱਤਾ!

ਉਹ ਭੱਜ ਕੇ ਪਹਾੜਾਂ ਤੇ ਗਈ ਤੇ ਬਰਫ਼ ਦਾ ਮਹਿਲ ਬਣਾਇਆ।

ਅੰਨਾ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਲੱਭਣ ਗਈ। "ਮੈਨੂੰ ਪਤਾ ਹੈ ਤੂੰ ਜਾਣਬੁੱਝ ਕੇ ਨਹੀਂ ਕੀਤਾ!"

"ਦੂਰ ਜਾ, ਅੰਨਾ! ਮੈਂ ਤੈਨੂੰ ਸੱਟ ਨਹੀਂ ਮਾਰਨਾ ਚਾਹੁੰਦੀ!" ਐਲਸਾ ਰੋਈ।

"ਮੈਂ ਤੇਰੇ ਤੋਂ ਨਹੀਂ ਡਰਦੀ," ਅੰਨਾ ਨੇ ਕਿਹਾ। "ਤੂੰ ਮੇਰੀ ਭੈਣ ਹੈਂ ਤੇ ਮੈਂ ਤੈਨੂੰ ਪਿਆਰ ਕਰਦੀ ਹਾਂ।"

ਪਰ ਇੱਕ ਦੁਰਘਟਨਾ ਹੋਈ - ਐਲਸਾ ਦੀ ਬਰਫ਼ ਅੰਨਾ ਦੇ ਦਿਲ ਵਿੱਚ ਲੱਗੀ!

ਅੰਨਾ ਜੰਮਣ ਲੱਗੀ। ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਸੱਚਾ ਪਿਆਰ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਬਚਾ ਸਕਦਾ ਸੀ।

ਫਿਰ ਅੰਨਾ ਨੇ ਦੇਖਿਆ ਕੋਈ ਐਲਸਾ ਨੂੰ ਨੁਕਸਾਨ ਪਹੁੰਚਾਉਣ ਵਾਲਾ ਸੀ!

ਆਪਣੀ ਆਖਰੀ ਤਾਕਤ ਨਾਲ, ਅੰਨਾ ਆਪਣੀ ਭੈਣ ਦੇ ਸਾਹਮਣੇ ਕੁੱਦ ਪਈ।

ਉਹ ਪੂਰੀ ਜੰਮ ਗਈ, ਐਲਸਾ ਨੂੰ ਬਚਾਉਂਦਿਆਂ।

ਐਲਸਾ ਨੇ ਆਪਣੀ ਜੰਮੀ ਭੈਣ ਨੂੰ ਗਲੇ ਲਾਇਆ, ਰੋਂਦਿਆਂ। "ਮੈਂ ਤੈਨੂੰ ਪਿਆਰ ਕਰਦੀ ਹਾਂ, ਅੰਨਾ!"

ਤੇ ਫਿਰ - ਅੰਨਾ ਪਿਘਲ ਗਈ! ਸੱਚਾ ਪਿਆਰ ਸੀ ਅੰਨਾ ਦਾ ਭੈਣ ਲਈ ਬਲੀਦਾਨ!

ਐਲਸਾ ਨੇ ਸਮਝਿਆ ਕਿ ਪਿਆਰ, ਡਰ ਨਹੀਂ, ਉਸਦੀਆਂ ਸ਼ਕਤੀਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਕੰਟਰੋਲ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ।

ਉਸਨੇ ਰਾਜ ਨੂੰ ਪਿਘਲਾਇਆ, ਤੇ ਭੈਣਾਂ ਫਿਰ ਕਦੇ ਵੱਖ ਨਹੀਂ ਹੋਈਆਂ।`,

ਉਸਦੇ ਪਿਤਾ, ਰਾਜਾ ਮੁਫਾਸਾ, ਨੇ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਪੂਰਾ ਰਾਜ ਦਿਖਾਇਆ।

"ਜਿੱਥੇ ਤੱਕ ਰੌਸ਼ਨੀ ਪਹੁੰਚਦੀ ਹੈ, ਉਹ ਸਾਡਾ ਘਰ ਹੈ," ਮੁਫਾਸਾ ਨੇ ਕਿਹਾ। "ਇੱਕ ਦਿਨ, ਤੂੰ ਰਾਜਾ ਬਣੇਂਗਾ।"

ਸਿੰਬਾ ਰਾਜਾ ਬਣਨ ਲਈ ਉਤਾਵਲਾ ਸੀ! ਉਹ ਖੇਡਦਾ ਤੇ ਉਤਸੁਕ ਸੀ।

ਪਰ ਸਿੰਬਾ ਦੇ ਚਾਚੇ ਸਕਾਰ ਨੂੰ ਈਰਖਾ ਸੀ। ਉਹ ਖ਼ੁਦ ਰਾਜਾ ਬਣਨਾ ਚਾਹੁੰਦਾ ਸੀ।

ਇੱਕ ਦਿਨ, ਸਕਾਰ ਨੇ ਸਿੰਬਾ ਨੂੰ ਇੱਕ ਖ਼ਤਰਨਾਕ ਘਾਟੀ ਵਿੱਚ ਫਸਾਇਆ।

ਭਗਦੜ ਆਈ! ਮੁਫਾਸਾ ਨੇ ਸਿੰਬਾ ਨੂੰ ਬਚਾਇਆ ਪਰ ਚਟਾਨ ਤੋਂ ਡਿੱਗ ਪਿਆ।

"ਇਹ ਤੇਰੀ ਗਲਤੀ ਹੈ!" ਸਕਾਰ ਨੇ ਝੂਠ ਬੋਲਿਆ। "ਭੱਜ ਜਾ ਤੇ ਕਦੇ ਵਾਪਸ ਨਾ ਆ!"

ਸਿੰਬਾ ਦੂਰ ਭੱਜ ਗਿਆ, ਦੋਸ਼ ਤੇ ਦੁੱਖ ਨਾਲ ਭਰਿਆ।

ਉਸਨੇ ਦੋ ਮਜ਼ੇਦਾਰ ਦੋਸਤ ਬਣਾਏ, ਟਿਮੋਨ ਤੇ ਪੁੰਬਾ।

"ਹਕੁਨਾ ਮਟਾਟਾ!" ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੇ ਸਿਖਾਇਆ। "ਇਸਦਾ ਮਤਲਬ ਹੈ ਕੋਈ ਚਿੰਤਾ ਨਹੀਂ!"

ਸਿੰਬਾ ਵੱਡਾ ਹੋਇਆ ਖੁਸ਼, ਪਰ ਹਮੇਸ਼ਾ ਕੁਝ ਖਾਲੀ ਲੱਗਦਾ ਸੀ।

ਇੱਕ ਦਿਨ, ਉਸਦੀ ਬਚਪਨ ਦੀ ਦੋਸਤ ਨਾਲਾ ਨੇ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਲੱਭਿਆ। "ਸਿੰਬਾ! ਰਾਜ ਨੂੰ ਤੇਰੀ ਲੋੜ ਹੈ!"

ਉਸ ਰਾਤ, ਸਿੰਬਾ ਨੇ ਤਾਰਿਆਂ ਵੱਲ ਦੇਖਿਆ। ਉਸਨੇ ਆਪਣੇ ਪਿਤਾ ਦਾ ਚਿਹਰਾ ਦੇਖਿਆ!

"ਤੂੰ ਮੇਰਾ ਪੁੱਤਰ ਹੈਂ, ਤੇ ਅਸਲੀ ਰਾਜਾ," ਮੁਫਾਸਾ ਦੀ ਆਤਮਾ ਨੇ ਕਿਹਾ। "ਯਾਦ ਰੱਖ ਤੂੰ ਕੌਣ ਹੈਂ।"

ਸਿੰਬਾ ਜਾਣਦਾ ਸੀ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਕੀ ਕਰਨਾ ਹੈ।

ਉਹ ਘਰ ਵਾਪਸ ਆਇਆ। ਸਕਾਰ ਦੇ ਰਾਜ ਵਿੱਚ ਜ਼ਮੀਨ ਸੁੱਕੀ ਤੇ ਉਦਾਸ ਸੀ।

"ਮੈਂ ਵਾਪਸ ਆ ਗਿਆ!" ਸਿੰਬਾ ਨੇ ਐਲਾਨ ਕੀਤਾ।

ਸਕਾਰ ਨੇ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਦੋਸ਼ ਦੇਣ ਦੀ ਕੋਸ਼ਿਸ਼ ਕੀਤੀ, ਪਰ ਸੱਚ ਸਾਹਮਣੇ ਆ ਗਿਆ।

ਸਿੰਬਾ ਨੇ ਆਪਣੇ ਚਾਚੇ ਨੂੰ ਹਰਾਇਆ। ਮੀਂਹ ਪੈਣ ਲੱਗਾ, ਤੇ ਜ਼ਮੀਨ ਫਿਰ ਜਿਉਂਦੀ ਹੋ ਗਈ।

ਸਿੰਬਾ ਇੱਕ ਸਿਆਣਾ ਤੇ ਚੰਗਾ ਰਾਜਾ ਬਣਿਆ, ਆਪਣੇ ਪਿਤਾ ਵਾਂਗ।`,

ਉਹ ਗਰੀਬ ਸੀ ਪਰ ਹਮੇਸ਼ਾ ਆਪਣੀ ਰੋਟੀ ਭੁੱਖਿਆਂ ਨਾਲ ਵੰਡਦਾ ਸੀ।

ਇੱਕ ਦਿਨ, ਅਲੀ ਨੂੰ ਇੱਕ ਗੁਫ਼ਾ ਵਿੱਚ ਇੱਕ ਧੂੜ ਭਰਿਆ ਪੁਰਾਣਾ ਦੀਵਾ ਮਿਲਿਆ।

ਜਦੋਂ ਉਸਨੇ ਇਸਨੂੰ ਰਗੜਿਆ, ਵੂਸ਼! ਇੱਕ ਦੋਸਤਾਨਾ ਜਿੰਨ ਨਿਕਲਿਆ!

"ਤੂੰ ਮੈਨੂੰ ਆਜ਼ਾਦ ਕੀਤਾ! ਮੈਂ ਤੈਨੂੰ ਤਿੰਨ ਇੱਛਾਵਾਂ ਦਿਆਂਗਾ!"

ਅਲੀ ਨੇ ਧਿਆਨ ਨਾਲ ਸੋਚਿਆ। ਉਸਨੇ ਸੋਨਾ ਜਾਂ ਮਹਿਲ ਨਹੀਂ ਮੰਗਿਆ।

"ਮੈਂ ਦੂਜਿਆਂ ਦੀ ਮਦਦ ਕਰਨਾ ਚਾਹੁੰਦਾ ਹਾਂ," ਅਲੀ ਨੇ ਕਿਹਾ। "ਤੇ ਉੱਡਣਾ!"

ਜਿੰਨ ਨੇ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਇੱਕ ਜਾਦੂਈ ਕਾਲੀਨ ਦਿੱਤੀ ਜੋ ਅਸਮਾਨ ਵਿੱਚ ਉੱਡ ਸਕਦੀ ਸੀ!

ਅਲੀ ਸ਼ਹਿਰ ਦੇ ਉੱਪਰ ਉੱਡਿਆ, ਮੁਸੀਬਤ ਵਿੱਚ ਲੋਕਾਂ ਦੀ ਮਦਦ ਕਰਦਾ।

ਉਸਨੇ ਇੱਕ ਬਿੱਲੀ ਨੂੰ ਉੱਚੇ ਰੁੱਖ ਤੋਂ ਬਚਾਇਆ। ਬੀਮਾਰ ਦਾਦੀ ਨੂੰ ਦਵਾਈ ਪਹੁੰਚਾਈ।

ਰਾਜਕੁਮਾਰੀ ਨੇ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਉੱਡਦੇ ਦੇਖਿਆ। "ਉਹ ਦਿਆਲੂ ਮੁੰਡਾ ਕੌਣ ਹੈ?"

ਉਸਨੇ ਅਲੀ ਨੂੰ ਮਹਿਲ ਵਿੱਚ ਬੁਲਾਇਆ। ਉਹ ਤੁਰੰਤ ਦੋਸਤ ਬਣ ਗਏ।

"ਮੈਨੂੰ ਪਰਵਾਹ ਨਹੀਂ ਕਿ ਤੂੰ ਅਮੀਰ ਨਹੀਂ," ਰਾਜਕੁਮਾਰੀ ਨੇ ਕਿਹਾ। "ਤੇਰਾ ਦਿਲ ਅਮੀਰ ਹੈ।"

ਇੱਕ ਦੁਸ਼ਟ ਜਾਦੂਗਰ ਨੇ ਅਲੀ ਦਾ ਦੀਵਾ ਚੁਰਾਉਣ ਦੀ ਕੋਸ਼ਿਸ਼ ਕੀਤੀ।

ਪਰ ਅਲੀ ਚਲਾਕ ਸੀ। ਉਸਨੇ ਜਾਦੂਗਰ ਨੂੰ ਮੂਰਖ ਬਣਾਇਆ ਤੇ ਦਿਨ ਬਚਾਇਆ!

ਅਲੀ ਨੇ ਆਪਣੀ ਆਖਰੀ ਇੱਛਾ ਜਿੰਨ ਨੂੰ ਆਜ਼ਾਦ ਕਰਨ ਲਈ ਵਰਤੀ।

ਉਹ ਔਰਤ ਅਸਲ ਵਿੱਚ ਇੱਕ ਸ਼ਕਤੀਸ਼ਾਲੀ ਪਰੀ ਸੀ। ਉਸਨੇ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਰਾਖਸ਼ ਬਣਨ ਦਾ ਸਰਾਪ ਦਿੱਤਾ!

"ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਸੱਚਾ ਪਿਆਰ ਇਸ ਸਰਾਪ ਨੂੰ ਤੋੜ ਸਕਦਾ ਹੈ," ਉਸਨੇ ਕਿਹਾ।

ਸਾਲ ਬੀਤੇ। ਰਾਖਸ਼ ਆਪਣੇ ਮਹਿਲ ਵਿੱਚ ਇਕੱਲਾ ਰਹਿੰਦਾ ਸੀ, ਉਦਾਸ ਤੇ ਗੁੱਸੇ ਵਿੱਚ।

ਇੱਕ ਦਿਨ, ਇੱਕ ਵਪਾਰੀ ਰਸਤਾ ਭੁੱਲ ਗਿਆ ਤੇ ਮਹਿਲ ਪਹੁੰਚਿਆ। ਉਸਨੇ ਆਪਣੀ ਧੀ ਬੇਲਾ ਲਈ ਇੱਕ ਗੁਲਾਬ ਤੋੜਿਆ।

"ਤੂੰ ਮੇਰਾ ਗੁਲਾਬ ਚੋਰੀ ਕੀਤਾ!" ਰਾਖਸ਼ ਗਰਜਿਆ। "ਤੈਨੂੰ ਕੀਮਤ ਚੁਕਾਉਣੀ ਪਵੇਗੀ!"

ਬੇਲਾ ਆਪਣੇ ਪਿਤਾ ਦੀ ਜਗ੍ਹਾ ਲੈਣ ਆਈ। ਉਹ ਡਰੀ ਹੋਈ ਸੀ ਪਰ ਬਹਾਦਰ।

ਪਹਿਲਾਂ, ਰਾਖਸ਼ ਚਿੜਚਿੜਾ ਤੇ ਰੁੱਖਾ ਸੀ। ਬੇਲਾ ਨੂੰ ਉਹ ਬਿਲਕੁਲ ਪਸੰਦ ਨਹੀਂ ਸੀ।

ਪਰ ਹੌਲੀ-ਹੌਲੀ, ਚੀਜ਼ਾਂ ਬਦਲੀਆਂ।

ਰਾਖਸ਼ ਨੇ ਬੇਲਾ ਨੂੰ ਆਪਣੀ ਕਿਤਾਬਾਂ ਨਾਲ ਭਰੀ ਲਾਇਬ੍ਰੇਰੀ ਦਿਖਾਈ। ਉਸਨੂੰ ਪੜ੍ਹਨਾ ਬਹੁਤ ਪਸੰਦ ਸੀ!

ਉਸਨੇ ਪੰਛੀਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਆਪਣੇ ਹੱਥਾਂ ਤੋਂ ਖਾਣਾ ਖਵਾਇਆ। ਉਹ ਇੰਨਾ ਡਰਾਉਣਾ ਨਹੀਂ ਸੀ।

ਬੇਲਾ ਨੇ ਰਾਖਸ਼ ਨੂੰ ਕੋਮਲ ਹੋਣਾ ਸਿਖਾਇਆ। ਉਹ ਇਕੱਠੇ ਪੜ੍ਹਦੇ, ਬਾਗ਼ ਵਿੱਚ ਘੁੰਮਦੇ, ਤੇ ਹੱਸਦੇ।

"ਉਹ ਅੰਦਰੋਂ ਰਾਖਸ਼ ਨਹੀਂ ਹੈ," ਬੇਲਾ ਨੇ ਮਹਿਸੂਸ ਕੀਤਾ। "ਉਸਦਾ ਦਿਲ ਚੰਗਾ ਹੈ।"

ਇੱਕ ਦਿਨ, ਬੇਲਾ ਨੇ ਜਾਦੂਈ ਸ਼ੀਸ਼ੇ ਵਿੱਚ ਆਪਣੇ ਬੀਮਾਰ ਪਿਤਾ ਨੂੰ ਦੇਖਿਆ। "ਮੈਨੂੰ ਜਾਣਾ ਪਵੇਗਾ!"

ਰਾਖਸ਼ ਨੇ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਜਾਣ ਦਿੱਤਾ, ਭਾਵੇਂ ਇਸ ਨਾਲ ਉਸਦਾ ਦਿਲ ਟੁੱਟ ਗਿਆ।

ਬੇਲਾ ਨੇ ਆਪਣੇ ਪਿਤਾ ਨੂੰ ਠੀਕ ਕੀਤਾ। ਪਰ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਰਾਖਸ਼ ਦੀ ਬਹੁਤ ਯਾਦ ਆਈ।

ਉਹ ਵਾਪਸ ਮਹਿਲ ਗਈ ਤੇ ਰਾਖਸ਼ ਨੂੰ ਬਹੁਤ ਕਮਜ਼ੋਰ ਪਾਇਆ।

"ਤੂੰ ਵਾਪਸ ਆ ਗਈ!" ਉਸਨੇ ਫੁਸਫੁਸਾਇਆ।

"ਮੈਂ ਤੈਨੂੰ ਪਿਆਰ ਕਰਦੀ ਹਾਂ," ਬੇਲਾ ਨੇ ਅੱਖਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਹੰਝੂ ਲੈ ਕੇ ਕਿਹਾ।

ਅਚਾਨਕ, ਰਾਖਸ਼ ਦੇ ਚਾਰੇ ਪਾਸੇ ਜਾਦੂ ਘੁੰਮਿਆ। ਉਹ ਰਾਜਕੁਮਾਰ ਵਿੱਚ ਬਦਲ ਗਿਆ!

"ਤੇਰੇ ਪਿਆਰ ਨੇ ਸਰਾਪ ਤੋੜ ਦਿੱਤਾ," ਉਸਨੇ ਕਿਹਾ।
