    content: `Once upon a time, a witch kept a girl named Rapunzel locked in a tall tower.

Rapunzel had never been outside. Her only company was her beautiful, magical golden hair that grew and grew.

It was so long, it could reach the ground from the tower window!

Every day, the witch would call, "Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair!"

Rapunzel would lower her hair, and the witch would climb up.

Rapunzel spent her days singing, painting, and dreaming of the outside world.

"What are those floating lights I see every year on my birthday?" she wondered.

One day, a young man named Flynn was running through the forest. He discovered the hidden tower!

He heard Rapunzel singing and climbed up her hair.

Rapunzel was scared at first, but Flynn was kind. He told her about the world outside.

"Those lights you see are lanterns," he said. "The kingdom releases them for the lost princess."

"I want to see them up close!" Rapunzel said.

They made a deal. Flynn would take her to see the lanterns.

Rapunzel climbed down from her tower for the first time ever!

The world was amazing! Grass, flowers, birds - everything was wonderful!

They reached the kingdom on her birthday. As the lanterns floated up, Rapunzel felt something magical.

The king and queen saw her and gasped. "Our daughter! The lost princess!"

Rapunzel had been the missing princess all along! The witch had stolen her as a baby.

Rapunzel was reunited with her real family. She was finally free!

And she never had to stay in a tower again.`,

    content: `Once there was a princess named Snow White with skin as white as snow and hair as black as night.

Her stepmother, the Queen, was very vain. She had a magic mirror.

"Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?"

"Snow White is the fairest," the mirror replied.

The Queen was jealous! She ordered Snow White to leave the castle.

Poor Snow White ran into the dark forest, scared and alone.

She found a tiny cottage and went inside. Everything was so small!

There were seven tiny beds, seven tiny chairs, and seven tiny plates.

Snow White was so tired, she fell asleep across the tiny beds.

When she woke up, seven friendly dwarfs were staring at her!

"Who are you?" they asked.

Snow White told them her story. The kind dwarfs said she could stay.

"We'll protect you!" they promised.

Snow White cooked and cleaned while the dwarfs worked in the diamond mines.

They were all very happy together.

But the Queen found out Snow White was alive! She disguised herself as an old woman.

She gave Snow White a poisoned apple. One bite, and Snow White fell into a deep sleep!

The dwarfs were heartbroken. They couldn't wake her up.

A prince who had met Snow White came looking for her. He saw her sleeping peacefully.

"She's so beautiful," he said sadly, and kissed her hand.

Suddenly, Snow White's eyes opened! True love had broken the spell!

Snow White thanked her seven friends. "You saved me by giving me a home."

She visited the dwarfs often, and they all lived happily ever after.`,

Times were hard, and there was little food.

One day, they got lost deep in the forest.

But the birds had eaten all the crumbs!

They walked and walked until they found an amazing house.

"Look!" cried Gretel. "It's made of candy and cake!"

The walls were gingerbread! The roof was chocolate! The windows were sugar!

They were so hungry, they started eating the house.

An old woman came out. "Come in, children! I have more treats inside!"

She seemed kind, but she was really a wicked witch!

She locked Hansel in a cage. "I'll fatten you up and eat you!"

Poor Gretel had to cook for the witch every day.

"Is he fat yet?" the witch would ask.

Clever Hansel held out a chicken bone instead of his finger. The witch couldn't see well.

"Still too thin!" she'd say.

Finally, the witch got impatient. "I'll eat him anyway! Gretel, light the oven!"

Gretel had a plan. "I don't know how. Can you show me?"

When the witch looked in the oven, brave Gretel pushed her in and shut the door!

She freed Hansel. "We did it! We're safe!"

They found the witch's treasure - jewels and gold!

They followed a friendly bird back home. Their father was overjoyed to see them!

With the treasure, they never went hungry again.`,

Jack agreed! But his mother was furious.

"Beans? You traded our cow for BEANS?" She threw them out the window.

That night, something magical happened.

A giant beanstalk grew up, up, up into the clouds!

Jack climbed the beanstalk. At the top, he found a huge castle!

Inside lived a giant and his wife.

"Fee-fi-fo-fum!" roared the giant. He was enormous!

Jack hid as the giant counted his gold coins. Then the giant fell asleep.

Jack grabbed some coins and climbed down the beanstalk!

His mother was amazed! They bought food and lived well.

But Jack was curious. He climbed up again!

This time, he found a hen that laid golden eggs!

He took the hen and climbed down quickly.

Jack climbed up one more time. He found a golden harp that played beautiful music.

But the harp cried out, "Master! Help!"

The giant woke up and chased Jack!

Jack slid down the beanstalk as fast as he could.

"Mother, bring the axe!" he shouted.

Jack chopped down the beanstalk. TIMBER! The giant fell and was never seen again.

Little Red Riding Hood skipped through the forest, singing happily.

"To my grandma's house," she said, forgetting her mother's warning.

The sneaky wolf ran ahead to Grandma's house!

He knocked on the door. "It's Little Red Riding Hood!"

Grandma opened the door, and the wolf locked her in the closet!

Then he put on Grandma's clothes and got in her bed.

"The better to see you with, my dear."

"Grandma, what big ears you have!"

"The better to hear you with, my dear."

"Grandma, what big teeth you have!"

"You're ugly!" they teased.

The poor duckling was sad. Nobody wanted to play with him.

The chickens pecked at him. The other ducks laughed at him.

"Maybe I don't belong here," the duckling thought.

He ran away from the farm.

Winter came. It was cold and lonely. The duckling hid in the reeds.

He saw beautiful white birds flying south. "I wish I was beautiful like them."

The long winter finally ended. Spring arrived!

The duckling saw the white birds again, swimming on a pond.

"I'll ask if I can be near them, even if they chase me away."

He swam toward them, looking down sadly.

But then he saw his reflection in the water!

He wasn't an ugly gray duckling anymore.

He was a beautiful white swan!

"Welcome, brother!" said the other swans.

The duckling - now a swan - couldn't believe it.

Children at the pond pointed. "Look at that beautiful swan! He's the prettiest one!"

The swan remembered when everyone called him ugly.

Now he was the most beautiful bird on the pond.

She saw three bowls of porridge.

She tasted Papa Bear's. "Too hot!"

She tasted Mama Bear's. "Too cold!"

She tasted Baby Bear's. "Just right!" She ate it all up.

Papa Bear's was too hard. Mama Bear's was too soft.

Baby Bear's was just right! But CRACK - she broke it!

Goldilocks was tired. She went upstairs and found three beds.

The princess hung her head. "Yes, Father."

"A promise is a promise," said the king. "You must keep your word."

She let him eat from her plate.

She even let him sleep on her pillow!

"This is awful!" she thought.

But she had promised, so she kept her word.

"Thank you," he said. "A witch turned me into a frog. Only someone keeping a difficult promise could break the spell."

उसने खिड़की से झाँका। "कोई घर पर नहीं है। मैं बस अंदर देखूंगी!"

उसने दलिया के तीन कटोरे देखे।

उसने पापा भालू का चखा। "बहुत गर्म!"

उसने मामा भालू का चखा। "बहुत ठंडा!"

उसने बेबी भालू का चखा। "एकदम सही!" उसने सब खा लिया।

फिर उसने तीन कुर्सियाँ देखीं।

पापा भालू की बहुत सख्त थी। मामा भालू की बहुत नरम थी।

बेबी भालू की एकदम सही थी! लेकिन कड़ाक - वह टूट गई!

गोल्डीलॉक्स थक गई थी। वह ऊपर गई और तीन बिस्तर देखे।

पापा भालू का बहुत सख्त था। मामा भालू का बहुत नरम था।

बेबी भालू का एकदम सही था! वह गहरी नींद सो गई।

जल्द ही, भालू घर आए।

"किसी ने मेरा दलिया खाया!" पापा भालू ने कहा।

"किसी ने मेरा दलिया खाया!" मामा भालू ने कहा।

"किसी ने मेरा सारा दलिया खा लिया!" बेबी भालू रोया।

उन्होंने कुर्सियाँ देखीं। "किसी ने मेरी कुर्सी तोड़ दी!" बेबी भालू रोया।

वे ऊपर गए।

"किसी ने मेरे बिस्तर पर सोया!" पापा भालू ने कहा।

"किसी ने मेरे बिस्तर पर सोया!" मामा भालू ने कहा।

"कोई अभी भी मेरे बिस्तर पर सो रहा है!" बेबी भालू चिल्लाया।

गोल्डीलॉक्स जागी और तीन भालू देखे!

"आह!" वह खिड़की से कूदी और घर भाग गई।

उसने फिर कभी बिना पूछे किसी के घर में प्रवेश नहीं किया!`,

    content: `ਬਹੁਤ ਸਮਾਂ ਪਹਿਲਾਂ, ਇੱਕ ਜਾਦੂਗਰਨੀ ਨੇ ਰੈਪਨਜ਼ਲ ਨਾਮ ਦੀ ਕੁੜੀ ਨੂੰ ਇੱਕ ਉੱਚੇ ਬੁਰਜ ਵਿੱਚ ਬੰਦ ਕਰ ਰੱਖਿਆ ਸੀ।

ਰੈਪਨਜ਼ਲ ਕਦੇ ਬਾਹਰ ਨਹੀਂ ਗਈ ਸੀ। ਉਸਦੇ ਕੋਲ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਉਸਦੇ ਸੋਹਣੇ, ਜਾਦੂਈ ਸੁਨਹਿਰੇ ਵਾਲ ਸਨ ਜੋ ਵਧਦੇ ਹੀ ਜਾਂਦੇ ਸਨ।

ਉਹ ਇੰਨੇ ਲੰਬੇ ਸਨ ਕਿ ਬੁਰਜ ਦੀ ਖਿੜਕੀ ਤੋਂ ਜ਼ਮੀਨ ਤੱਕ ਪਹੁੰਚ ਜਾਂਦੇ ਸਨ!

ਹਰ ਰੋਜ਼, ਜਾਦੂਗਰਨੀ ਪੁਕਾਰਦੀ, "ਰੈਪਨਜ਼ਲ, ਰੈਪਨਜ਼ਲ, ਆਪਣੇ ਵਾਲ ਹੇਠਾਂ ਕਰ!"

ਰੈਪਨਜ਼ਲ ਆਪਣੇ ਵਾਲ ਹੇਠਾਂ ਕਰਦੀ, ਤੇ ਜਾਦੂਗਰਨੀ ਉੱਪਰ ਚੜ੍ਹਦੀ।

ਰੈਪਨਜ਼ਲ ਆਪਣੇ ਦਿਨ ਗਾਉਂਦਿਆਂ, ਤਸਵੀਰਾਂ ਬਣਾਉਂਦਿਆਂ, ਤੇ ਬਾਹਰ ਦੀ ਦੁਨੀਆ ਦੇ ਸੁਪਨੇ ਲੈਂਦਿਆਂ ਬਿਤਾਉਂਦੀ।

"ਉਹ ਤੈਰਦੀਆਂ ਰੌਸ਼ਨੀਆਂ ਕੀ ਹਨ ਜੋ ਮੈਂ ਹਰ ਸਾਲ ਆਪਣੇ ਜਨਮਦਿਨ ਤੇ ਦੇਖਦੀ ਹਾਂ?" ਉਹ ਸੋਚਦੀ।

ਇੱਕ ਦਿਨ, ਫਲਿਨ ਨਾਮ ਦਾ ਇੱਕ ਮੁੰਡਾ ਜੰਗਲ ਵਿੱਚੋਂ ਭੱਜ ਰਿਹਾ ਸੀ। ਉਸਨੇ ਲੁਕਿਆ ਹੋਇਆ ਬੁਰਜ ਲੱਭ ਲਿਆ!

ਉਸਨੇ ਰੈਪਨਜ਼ਲ ਨੂੰ ਗਾਉਂਦਿਆਂ ਸੁਣਿਆ ਤੇ ਉਸਦੇ ਵਾਲਾਂ ਤੇ ਚੜ੍ਹ ਗਿਆ।

ਰੈਪਨਜ਼ਲ ਪਹਿਲਾਂ ਡਰ ਗਈ, ਪਰ ਫਲਿਨ ਦਿਆਲੂ ਸੀ। ਉਸਨੇ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਬਾਹਰ ਦੀ ਦੁਨੀਆ ਬਾਰੇ ਦੱਸਿਆ।

"ਉਹ ਰੌਸ਼ਨੀਆਂ ਲਾਲਟੈਣਾਂ ਹਨ," ਉਸਨੇ ਕਿਹਾ। "ਰਾਜ ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਗੁਆਚੀ ਹੋਈ ਰਾਜਕੁਮਾਰੀ ਲਈ ਛੱਡਦਾ ਹੈ।"

"ਮੈਂ ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਨੇੜੇ ਤੋਂ ਦੇਖਣਾ ਚਾਹੁੰਦੀ ਹਾਂ!" ਰੈਪਨਜ਼ਲ ਨੇ ਕਿਹਾ।

ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੇ ਸੌਦਾ ਕੀਤਾ। ਫਲਿਨ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਲਾਲਟੈਣਾਂ ਦੇਖਣ ਲੈ ਜਾਵੇਗਾ।

ਰੈਪਨਜ਼ਲ ਪਹਿਲੀ ਵਾਰ ਆਪਣੇ ਬੁਰਜ ਤੋਂ ਹੇਠਾਂ ਉਤਰੀ!

ਦੁਨੀਆ ਅਦਭੁਤ ਸੀ! ਘਾਹ, ਫੁੱਲ, ਪੰਛੀ - ਸਭ ਕੁਝ ਸ਼ਾਨਦਾਰ ਸੀ!

ਉਹ ਉਸਦੇ ਜਨਮਦਿਨ ਤੇ ਰਾਜ ਪਹੁੰਚੇ। ਜਿਵੇਂ ਲਾਲਟੈਣਾਂ ਉੱਪਰ ਤੈਰੀਆਂ, ਰੈਪਨਜ਼ਲ ਨੇ ਕੁਝ ਜਾਦੂਈ ਮਹਿਸੂਸ ਕੀਤਾ।

ਰਾਜੇ ਤੇ ਰਾਣੀ ਨੇ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਦੇਖਿਆ ਤੇ ਹੈਰਾਨ ਹੋ ਗਏ। "ਸਾਡੀ ਧੀ! ਗੁਆਚੀ ਹੋਈ ਰਾਜਕੁਮਾਰੀ!"

ਰੈਪਨਜ਼ਲ ਹਮੇਸ਼ਾ ਤੋਂ ਲਾਪਤਾ ਰਾਜਕੁਮਾਰੀ ਸੀ! ਜਾਦੂਗਰਨੀ ਨੇ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਬਚਪਨ ਵਿੱਚ ਚੁਰਾ ਲਿਆ ਸੀ।

ਰੈਪਨਜ਼ਲ ਆਪਣੇ ਅਸਲੀ ਪਰਿਵਾਰ ਨਾਲ ਮਿਲੀ। ਉਹ ਆਖ਼ਰਕਾਰ ਆਜ਼ਾਦ ਸੀ!`,

    content: `ਇੱਕ ਵਾਰ ਇੱਕ ਰਾਜਕੁਮਾਰੀ ਸੀ ਜਿਸਦਾ ਨਾਮ ਸਨੋ ਵ੍ਹਾਈਟ ਸੀ। ਉਸਦੀ ਚਮੜੀ ਬਰਫ਼ ਵਰਗੀ ਗੋਰੀ ਤੇ ਵਾਲ ਰਾਤ ਵਰਗੇ ਕਾਲੇ ਸਨ।

ਉਸਦੀ ਮਤਰੇਈ ਮਾਂ, ਰਾਣੀ, ਬਹੁਤ ਘਮੰਡੀ ਸੀ। ਉਸਦੇ ਕੋਲ ਇੱਕ ਜਾਦੂਈ ਸ਼ੀਸ਼ਾ ਸੀ।

"ਸ਼ੀਸ਼ੇ, ਸ਼ੀਸ਼ੇ, ਦੱਸ ਮੈਨੂੰ, ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਸੋਹਣੀ ਕੌਣ ਹੈ?"

"ਸਨੋ ਵ੍ਹਾਈਟ ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਸੋਹਣੀ ਹੈ," ਸ਼ੀਸ਼ੇ ਨੇ ਜਵਾਬ ਦਿੱਤਾ।

ਰਾਣੀ ਨੂੰ ਈਰਖਾ ਹੋਈ! ਉਸਨੇ ਸਨੋ ਵ੍ਹਾਈਟ ਨੂੰ ਮਹਿਲ ਛੱਡਣ ਦਾ ਹੁਕਮ ਦਿੱਤਾ।

ਬੇਚਾਰੀ ਸਨੋ ਵ੍ਹਾਈਟ ਹਨੇਰੇ ਜੰਗਲ ਵਿੱਚ ਭੱਜ ਗਈ, ਡਰੀ ਹੋਈ ਤੇ ਇਕੱਲੀ।

ਉਸਨੂੰ ਇੱਕ ਛੋਟੀ ਜਿਹੀ ਝੌਂਪੜੀ ਮਿਲੀ। ਅੰਦਰ ਸਭ ਕੁਝ ਬਹੁਤ ਛੋਟਾ ਸੀ!

ਸੱਤ ਛੋਟੇ ਬਿਸਤਰੇ, ਸੱਤ ਛੋਟੀਆਂ ਕੁਰਸੀਆਂ, ਤੇ ਸੱਤ ਛੋਟੀਆਂ ਪਲੇਟਾਂ ਸਨ।

ਸਨੋ ਵ੍ਹਾਈਟ ਬਹੁਤ ਥੱਕੀ ਹੋਈ ਸੀ, ਉਹ ਛੋਟੇ ਬਿਸਤਰਿਆਂ ਤੇ ਸੌਂ ਗਈ।

ਜਦੋਂ ਉਹ ਜਾਗੀ, ਸੱਤ ਦੋਸਤਾਨੇ ਬੌਣੇ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਘੂਰ ਰਹੇ ਸਨ!

"ਤੂੰ ਕੌਣ ਹੈਂ?" ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੇ ਪੁੱਛਿਆ।

ਸਨੋ ਵ੍ਹਾਈਟ ਨੇ ਆਪਣੀ ਕਹਾਣੀ ਦੱਸੀ। ਦਿਆਲੂ ਬੌਣਿਆਂ ਨੇ ਕਿਹਾ ਉਹ ਰਹਿ ਸਕਦੀ ਹੈ।

"ਅਸੀਂ ਤੇਰੀ ਰੱਖਿਆ ਕਰਾਂਗੇ!" ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੇ ਵਾਅਦਾ ਕੀਤਾ।

ਸਨੋ ਵ੍ਹਾਈਟ ਖਾਣਾ ਬਣਾਉਂਦੀ ਤੇ ਸਾਫ਼ ਕਰਦੀ ਜਦੋਂ ਬੌਣੇ ਖਾਣਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਕੰਮ ਕਰਦੇ।

ਉਹ ਸਾਰੇ ਬਹੁਤ ਖੁਸ਼ ਸਨ।

ਪਰ ਰਾਣੀ ਨੂੰ ਪਤਾ ਲੱਗ ਗਿਆ ਕਿ ਸਨੋ ਵ੍ਹਾਈਟ ਜਿਉਂਦੀ ਹੈ! ਉਸਨੇ ਬੁੱਢੀ ਔਰਤ ਦਾ ਭੇਸ ਬਣਾਇਆ।

ਉਸਨੇ ਸਨੋ ਵ੍ਹਾਈਟ ਨੂੰ ਜ਼ਹਿਰੀਲਾ ਸੇਬ ਦਿੱਤਾ। ਇੱਕ ਵੱਢ ਖਾਂਦਿਆਂ ਹੀ, ਸਨੋ ਵ੍ਹਾਈਟ ਡੂੰਘੀ ਨੀਂਦ ਸੌਂ ਗਈ!

ਬੌਣੇ ਦੁਖੀ ਸਨ। ਉਹ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਜਗਾ ਨਾ ਸਕੇ।

ਇੱਕ ਰਾਜਕੁਮਾਰ ਜੋ ਸਨੋ ਵ੍ਹਾਈਟ ਨੂੰ ਮਿਲਿਆ ਸੀ, ਉਸਨੂੰ ਲੱਭਣ ਆਇਆ। ਉਸਨੇ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਸ਼ਾਂਤੀ ਨਾਲ ਸੁੱਤਿਆਂ ਦੇਖਿਆ।

"ਉਹ ਕਿੰਨੀ ਸੋਹਣੀ ਹੈ," ਉਸਨੇ ਉਦਾਸੀ ਨਾਲ ਕਿਹਾ, ਤੇ ਉਸਦੇ ਹੱਥ ਨੂੰ ਚੁੰਮਿਆ।

ਅਚਾਨਕ, ਸਨੋ ਵ੍ਹਾਈਟ ਦੀਆਂ ਅੱਖਾਂ ਖੁੱਲ੍ਹੀਆਂ! ਸੱਚੇ ਪਿਆਰ ਨੇ ਜਾਦੂ ਤੋੜ ਦਿੱਤਾ!

ਉਹ ਸਾਰੇ ਖੁਸ਼ੀ ਨਾਲ ਰਹੇ।`,

ਜੈਕ ਗਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਬਜ਼ਾਰ ਲੈ ਗਿਆ। ਰਸਤੇ ਵਿੱਚ, ਉਸਨੂੰ ਇੱਕ ਅਜੀਬ ਬੁੱਢਾ ਆਦਮੀ ਮਿਲਿਆ।

"ਮੈਂ ਤੇਰੀ ਗਾਂ ਦੇ ਬਦਲੇ ਇਹ ਜਾਦੂਈ ਫਲੀਆਂ ਦਿਆਂਗਾ," ਬੁੱਢੇ ਨੇ ਕਿਹਾ।

ਜੈਕ ਮੰਨ ਗਿਆ! ਪਰ ਉਸਦੀ ਮਾਂ ਬਹੁਤ ਗੁੱਸੇ ਹੋਈ।

"ਫਲੀਆਂ? ਤੂੰ ਸਾਡੀ ਗਾਂ ਫਲੀਆਂ ਦੇ ਬਦਲੇ ਵੇਚ ਦਿੱਤੀ?" ਉਸਨੇ ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਖਿੜਕੀ ਤੋਂ ਬਾਹਰ ਸੁੱਟ ਦਿੱਤਾ।

ਉਸ ਰਾਤ, ਕੁਝ ਜਾਦੂਈ ਹੋਇਆ।

ਇੱਕ ਵਿਸ਼ਾਲ ਵੇਲ ਉੱਗੀ, ਉੱਪਰ, ਉੱਪਰ, ਬੱਦਲਾਂ ਤੱਕ!

ਜੈਕ ਵੇਲ ਤੇ ਚੜ੍ਹ ਗਿਆ। ਉੱਪਰ, ਉਸਨੂੰ ਇੱਕ ਵਿਸ਼ਾਲ ਮਹਿਲ ਮਿਲਿਆ!

ਅੰਦਰ ਇੱਕ ਦੈਂਤ ਤੇ ਉਸਦੀ ਪਤਨੀ ਰਹਿੰਦੇ ਸਨ।

"ਫੀ-ਫਾਈ-ਫੋ-ਫਮ!" ਦੈਂਤ ਗਰਜਿਆ। ਉਹ ਬਹੁਤ ਵੱਡਾ ਸੀ!

ਜੈਕ ਛੁਪ ਗਿਆ ਜਦੋਂ ਦੈਂਤ ਆਪਣੇ ਸੋਨੇ ਦੇ ਸਿੱਕੇ ਗਿਣ ਰਿਹਾ ਸੀ। ਫਿਰ ਦੈਂਤ ਸੌਂ ਗਿਆ।

ਜੈਕ ਨੇ ਕੁਝ ਸਿੱਕੇ ਲਏ ਤੇ ਵੇਲ ਤੋਂ ਹੇਠਾਂ ਉਤਰ ਗਿਆ!

ਉਸਦੀ ਮਾਂ ਹੈਰਾਨ ਸੀ! ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੇ ਖਾਣਾ ਖਰੀਦਿਆ ਤੇ ਚੰਗੇ ਰਹੇ।

ਪਰ ਜੈਕ ਉਤਸੁਕ ਸੀ। ਉਹ ਫਿਰ ਉੱਪਰ ਚੜ੍ਹਿਆ!

ਇਸ ਵਾਰ, ਉਸਨੂੰ ਇੱਕ ਮੁਰਗੀ ਮਿਲੀ ਜੋ ਸੋਨੇ ਦੇ ਆਂਡੇ ਦਿੰਦੀ ਸੀ!

ਉਸਨੇ ਮੁਰਗੀ ਲਈ ਤੇ ਜਲਦੀ ਹੇਠਾਂ ਉਤਰ ਗਿਆ।

ਜੈਕ ਇੱਕ ਵਾਰ ਫਿਰ ਉੱਪਰ ਚੜ੍ਹਿਆ। ਉਸਨੂੰ ਇੱਕ ਸੁਨਹਿਰੀ ਰਬਾਬ ਮਿਲੀ ਜੋ ਸੋਹਣਾ ਸੰਗੀਤ ਵਜਾਉਂਦੀ ਸੀ।

ਪਰ ਰਬਾਬ ਚੀਕੀ, "ਮਾਲਕ! ਮਦਦ!"

ਦੈਂਤ ਜਾਗ ਗਿਆ ਤੇ ਜੈਕ ਦਾ ਪਿੱਛਾ ਕੀਤਾ!

ਜੈਕ ਜਿੰਨੀ ਜਲਦੀ ਹੋ ਸਕੇ ਵੇਲ ਤੋਂ ਹੇਠਾਂ ਫਿਸਲਿਆ।

"ਮਾਂ, ਕੁਹਾੜਾ ਲਿਆ!" ਉਸਨੇ ਚੀਕਿਆ।

ਜੈਕ ਨੇ ਵੇਲ ਕੱਟ ਦਿੱਤੀ। ਧੜਾਮ! ਦੈਂਤ ਡਿੱਗ ਪਿਆ ਤੇ ਫਿਰ ਕਦੇ ਨਹੀਂ ਦਿਖਿਆ।

ਜੈਕ ਤੇ ਉਸਦੀ ਮਾਂ ਆਪਣੀ ਸੋਨੇ ਦੀ ਮੁਰਗੀ ਨਾਲ ਖੁਸ਼ੀ ਨਾਲ ਰਹੇ।`,

ਪਰ ਇੱਕ ਆਂਡਾ ਵੱਡਾ ਸੀ। ਜਦੋਂ ਉਹ ਖੁੱਲ੍ਹਿਆ, ਇੱਕ ਸਲੇਟੀ, ਅਜੀਬ ਬੱਤਖ ਦਾ ਬੱਚਾ ਨਿਕਲਿਆ।

"ਉਹ ਸਾਡੇ ਵਰਗਾ ਨਹੀਂ ਦਿਖਦਾ," ਦੂਜੇ ਬੱਚਿਆਂ ਨੇ ਕਿਹਾ।

ਬੇਚਾਰਾ ਬੱਚਾ ਉਦਾਸ ਸੀ। ਕੋਈ ਉਸ ਨਾਲ ਖੇਡਣਾ ਨਹੀਂ ਸੀ ਚਾਹੁੰਦਾ।

ਮੁਰਗੀਆਂ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਚੁੰਝ ਮਾਰਦੀਆਂ। ਦੂਜੀਆਂ ਬੱਤਖਾਂ ਹੱਸਦੀਆਂ।

"ਸ਼ਾਇਦ ਮੈਂ ਇੱਥੇ ਦਾ ਨਹੀਂ ਹਾਂ," ਬੱਚੇ ਨੇ ਸੋਚਿਆ।

ਉਹ ਖੇਤ ਤੋਂ ਭੱਜ ਗਿਆ।

ਸਰਦੀ ਆ ਗਈ। ਠੰਢ ਸੀ ਤੇ ਇਕੱਲਾਪਨ। ਬੱਚਾ ਸਰਕੰਡਿਆਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਛੁਪਿਆ।

ਉਸਨੇ ਸੋਹਣੇ ਚਿੱਟੇ ਪੰਛੀਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਦੱਖਣ ਵੱਲ ਉੱਡਦੇ ਦੇਖਿਆ। "ਕਾਸ਼ ਮੈਂ ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਵਰਗਾ ਸੋਹਣਾ ਹੁੰਦਾ।"

ਲੰਬੀ ਸਰਦੀ ਆਖ਼ਰਕਾਰ ਖ਼ਤਮ ਹੋਈ। ਬਸੰਤ ਆ ਗਈ!

ਬੱਚੇ ਨੇ ਚਿੱਟੇ ਪੰਛੀਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਫਿਰ ਦੇਖਿਆ, ਤਲਾਬ ਵਿੱਚ ਤੈਰਦੇ ਹੋਏ।

"ਮੈਂ ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਤੋਂ ਪੁੱਛਾਂਗਾ ਕੀ ਮੈਂ ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਦੇ ਨੇੜੇ ਰਹਿ ਸਕਦਾ ਹਾਂ, ਭਾਵੇਂ ਉਹ ਮੈਨੂੰ ਭਜਾ ਦੇਣ।"

ਉਹ ਇੱਕ ਸੋਹਣਾ ਚਿੱਟਾ ਹੰਸ ਸੀ!

ਬੱਚਾ - ਹੁਣ ਹੰਸ - ਵਿਸ਼ਵਾਸ ਨਹੀਂ ਕਰ ਸਕਿਆ।

ਤਲਾਬ ਤੇ ਬੱਚਿਆਂ ਨੇ ਇਸ਼ਾਰਾ ਕੀਤਾ। "ਉਸ ਸੋਹਣੇ ਹੰਸ ਨੂੰ ਦੇਖੋ! ਉਹ ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਸੋਹਣਾ ਹੈ!"

ਹੰਸ ਨੂੰ ਯਾਦ ਆਇਆ ਜਦੋਂ ਸਾਰੇ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਬਦਸੂਰਤ ਕਹਿੰਦੇ ਸਨ।

ਹੁਣ ਉਹ ਤਲਾਬ ਦਾ ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਸੋਹਣਾ ਪੰਛੀ ਸੀ।

ਉਹ ਬਹੁਤ ਖੁਸ਼ ਸੀ, ਇਸ ਲਈ ਨਹੀਂ ਕਿ ਉਹ ਸੋਹਣਾ ਸੀ, ਪਰ ਇਸ ਲਈ ਕਿ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਆਖ਼ਰਕਾਰ ਆਪਣੀ ਥਾਂ ਮਿਲ ਗਈ।`,
