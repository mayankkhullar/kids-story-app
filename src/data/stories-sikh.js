    content: `On September 12, 1897, something amazing happened at Saragarhi, a small outpost in the mountains.

21 Sikh soldiers of the 36th Sikh Regiment were stationed there.

Their leader was Havildar Ishar Singh, a brave and devoted man.

One morning, they saw dust rising in the distance. An army of 10,000 Afghan warriors was coming!

The soldiers knew they couldn't win. But they had a duty - to protect the communication post.

"We could surrender," someone said.

"No," said Havildar Ishar Singh. "A Sikh never surrenders. We will fight."

They sent a message to the main fort: "We are under attack. We will fight to the last man."

The battle began. Wave after wave of enemies attacked.

The 21 Sikhs fought with incredible bravery. For every one of them, hundreds of enemies fell.

Sepoy Gurmukh Singh was the signalman. He kept reporting the battle to headquarters.

"Five of us are left... Three of us... Two of us..."

Hours passed. The small group held their ground.

Finally, only Gurmukh Singh remained. The enemy had broken through.

"The enemy is inside," he signaled. "I am the last one. Permission to fight?"

"Permission granted," came the reply.

Gurmukh Singh picked up his rifle and fought. He took down 20 more enemies before falling.

The 21 Sikhs had held off 10,000 men for seven hours!

The enemy suffered over 600 deaths and 1,000 injuries - from just 21 men.

The British Parliament gave a standing ovation when they heard the story.

Every year on September 12, Saragarhi Day is celebrated to honor these brave warriors.

Their sacrifice showed the world what courage truly means.`,
    moral: 'True bravery means doing your duty even when the odds are against you. Honor and courage live forever.',

    content: `Guru Gobind Singh Ji, the tenth Sikh Guru, had four beloved sons called Sahibzaade.

Baba Ajit Singh was 18, Baba Jujhar Singh was 14, Baba Zorawar Singh was 9, and Baba Fateh Singh was just 6.

The Mughal emperor wanted to destroy the Sikhs. His army attacked the Guru's fort at Anandpur Sahib.

The Sikhs fought bravely, but they were surrounded. The Guru and his family had to leave the fort.

While crossing the flooded Sirsa river at night, the family got separated.

The two elder Sahibzaade - Ajit Singh and Jujhar Singh - stayed with their father.

At the Battle of Chamkaur, they faced a huge Mughal army with just 40 Sikhs.

"Father, let me fight," said Baba Ajit Singh.

"Go, my son. Show them the strength of a Sikh," said Guru Gobind Singh Ji.

Baba Ajit Singh fought like a lion, defeating many enemies before attaining martyrdom.

Then 14-year-old Baba Jujhar Singh stepped forward. "It is my turn, Father."

He too fought with amazing bravery before joining his brother.

Meanwhile, the two younger Sahibzaade were with their grandmother, Mata Gujri Ji.

A servant betrayed them to the Mughals for money.

The young princes were brought before Wazir Khan, the Mughal governor.

"Become Muslims, and you will live as princes," he offered.

9-year-old Baba Zorawar Singh replied, "We are sons of Guru Gobind Singh Ji. We will never leave our faith."

6-year-old Baba Fateh Singh agreed. "We choose death over dishonor."

The cruel Wazir Khan ordered them to be bricked up alive in a wall.

Even as the wall rose around them, the young boys stood firm, reciting prayers.

They sacrificed their lives but never gave up their faith.

When Guru Gobind Singh Ji heard the news, he said, "My four sons have gone, but millions of Sikhs remain."

The Sahibzaade's sacrifice inspired Sikhs forever. Their bravery at such young ages showed the world what true faith means.`,
    moral: 'Standing up for what you believe in, even in the face of death, is the highest form of courage.',

    content: `Baba Deep Singh Ji was born in 1682 in Punjab. He became one of the most respected Sikh warriors.

He was a scholar too - he made many copies of the holy Guru Granth Sahib by hand.

When he was 75 years old, terrible news came.

Ahmed Shah Abdali's army had attacked the Golden Temple in Amritsar!

They had filled the sacred pool with garbage and cow blood.

Baba Deep Singh Ji was furious. "I will free our holy place or die trying!"

He gathered a small army of Sikhs. Many joined him on the way.

He drew a line on the ground with his heavy khanda (sword).

"Only those who are willing to give their lives should cross this line."

Every single Sikh crossed the line.

They marched toward Amritsar, fighting enemies along the way.

At Gohalwar village, near Amritsar, a fierce battle began.

Baba Deep Singh Ji, despite his old age, fought like a young lion.

He was fighting Jamal Khan, an enemy commander, when a terrible blow struck his neck.

His head was nearly severed! It hung to one side.

Any normal man would have fallen. But not Baba Deep Singh Ji.

He remembered his promise: "I will reach the Golden Temple!"

He held his head with his left hand and kept fighting with his right!

The enemies were terrified. They had never seen such determination.

Baba Deep Singh Ji kept fighting, moving toward the Golden Temple.

He finally reached the holy place and fell at its boundary, keeping his promise.

The Sikhs, inspired by his sacrifice, drove out all the invaders.

A gurdwara stands today where Baba Deep Singh Ji fell.

His story teaches us that nothing can stop someone with true determination.`,

She grew up learning horse riding, sword fighting, and shooting.

During a difficult time, the Guru was at Anandpur Sahib, surrounded by enemies.

Forty Sikhs from her village had been defending the fort. But things got very hard.

There was no food or water. The Sikhs were suffering.

Some Sikhs lost hope. They wrote a letter saying they were leaving the Guru.

When Mai Bhago heard about this, she was very upset.

"How could they abandon our Guru?" she said. "This is shameful!"

She gathered the forty deserters and shamed them.

"Are you not Sikhs? Did you forget your promise to the Guru?"

"Follow me! We will go back and fight!"

Inspired by her courage, all forty men agreed to return.

Mai Bhago led them into battle at Khidrana (now called Muktsar).

The Mughal army was huge, but the Sikhs fought bravely.

Mai Bhago fought at the front, her sword flashing.

It was a terrible battle. All forty Sikhs died fighting heroically.

Mai Bhago was badly wounded but survived.

The Guru came to the battlefield. He found the forty Sikhs who had returned.

The leader of the forty, Bhai Mahan Singh, was still alive.

"Forgive us, Guru Ji. We were wrong to leave."

The Guru was moved. He tore up the letter of desertion.

"You are not deserters. You are my Beloved Ones - Chali Mukte!"

Mai Bhago recovered from her wounds. She became the Guru's bodyguard.

She is remembered as a symbol of bravery and as a reminder that courage has no gender.`,

    description: 'The general whose name made enemies tremble',
    content: `Hari Singh Nalwa was born in 1791. He became one of the greatest warriors in Sikh history.

His name "Nalwa" came from an incredible event when he was young.

One day, while hunting, a lion attacked him!

Instead of running, young Hari Singh fought the lion with his bare hands.

He killed the lion and earned the name "Nalwa" - the lion killer!

He joined the army of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the Lion of Punjab.

Hari Singh quickly became a great general. He never lost a battle!

His bravery was legendary. Afghan mothers would tell their crying children:

"Be quiet, or Hari Singh Nalwa will come!"

His name alone was enough to scare the enemies of Punjab.

He conquered many territories and expanded the Sikh Empire.

But he wasn't just a warrior. He was also kind and fair.

He treated everyone equally, regardless of their religion.

He built roads, schools, and helped the poor.

In 1837, at the age of 46, he was defending the Jamrud Fort.

A massive Afghan army attacked. Hari Singh was wounded in battle.

Even wounded, he gave orders to his soldiers.

"Don't tell anyone I am hurt. Keep fighting!"

He knew that if the soldiers knew he was wounded, they might lose hope.

The Sikhs won the battle, but Hari Singh Nalwa died from his wounds.

His body was quickly cremated so the enemy wouldn't know he had fallen.

The Afghans only learned of his death much later. They were too scared to advance even after he was gone!

Hari Singh Nalwa's bravery protected Punjab's borders for years.`,

He lived during a terrible time when Sikhs were being hunted by the Mughal rulers.

The governor, Zakariya Khan, had put a price on the head of every Sikh.

Despite the danger, Bhai Taru Singh helped Sikh warriors who were hiding in forests.

He and his sister would save food from their own meals to feed the Sikh fighters.

Someone told the governor about Bhai Taru Singh's activities.

He was arrested and brought before Zakariya Khan in Lahore.

"You have been helping the Sikh rebels," said the governor. "The punishment is death."

"But I will spare you if you cut your hair and become a Muslim."

Bhai Taru Singh looked at the governor calmly.

"My hair is a gift from my Guru. I cannot cut it."

"Think carefully," warned the governor. "If you don't cut your hair, we will scrape your scalp off!"

Bhai Taru Singh replied, "You may take my scalp, but my faith will remain with me."

"Each hair is dear to me. I will not part with any of them."

The cruel governor ordered his men to carry out the terrible punishment.

As the barber scraped his scalp with a blade, Bhai Taru Singh kept reciting prayers.

He didn't cry out or beg for mercy.

The Sangat (Sikh community) watched in grief but also in awe of his courage.

Bhai Taru Singh said, "This governor will not survive to see next month."

Within 22 days, Zakariya Khan fell terribly ill and died in agony.

Bhai Taru Singh passed away too, but he died with his faith intact.

He showed the world that some things are more important than life itself.

His sacrifice strengthened the resolve of Sikhs everywhere.`,

As a young man, he became a hermit and was known as Madho Das.

He lived in a small hut and was said to have magical powers.

In 1708, Guru Gobind Singh Ji came to meet him.

"I have heard about your powers, Madho Das," said the Guru.

When Madho Das tried to use his powers on the Guru, nothing happened!

Amazed, he asked, "Who are you?"

"I am Gobind Singh. Who are you?"

Madho Das replied, "I am your Banda" (meaning "slave" or "servant").

From that day, he was known as Banda Singh Bahadur.

The Guru gave him five arrows, a sword, and a battle flag.

"Go to Punjab. The Mughals have killed my family and tortured Sikhs. Bring justice."

Banda Singh traveled to Punjab and gathered an army of Sikhs.

His first target was Wazir Khan, the governor who had killed the younger Sahibzaade.

At the Battle of Sirhind in 1710, Banda Singh's army defeated the Mughals!

Wazir Khan was killed. The Sahibzaade were avenged.

Banda Singh became the first Sikh king! He ruled a large territory.

He made important changes:
- He gave land to farmers who actually worked on it.
- He ended the zamindari system that oppressed the poor.
- He treated Hindus and Muslims fairly.

For eight years, he fought the mighty Mughal Empire.

Finally, after a long siege, he was captured in 1715.

The Mughals offered him freedom if he gave up his faith.

"Never," said Banda Singh Bahadur.

He was tortured terribly, but he didn't give in.

He died a martyr in 1716, but his legend lived on.

He showed that the Sikhs could defeat empires and rule with justice.`,

36वीं सिख रेजीमेंट के 21 सिख सैनिक वहां तैनात थे।

उनके नेता थे हवलदार ईशर सिंह, एक बहादुर और समर्पित व्यक्ति।

एक सुबह, उन्होंने दूर से धूल उठते देखी। 10,000 अफगान योद्धाओं की सेना आ रही थी!

सैनिक जानते थे कि वे जीत नहीं सकते। लेकिन उनका कर्तव्य था - संचार चौकी की रक्षा करना।

"हम आत्मसमर्पण कर सकते हैं," किसी ने कहा।

"नहीं," हवलदार ईशर सिंह ने कहा। "एक सिख कभी आत्मसमर्पण नहीं करता। हम लड़ेंगे।"

उन्होंने मुख्य किले को संदेश भेजा: "हम पर हमला हो रहा है। हम आखिरी आदमी तक लड़ेंगे।"

लड़ाई शुरू हुई। दुश्मनों की लहर पर लहर हमला करती रही।

21 सिखों ने अविश्वसनीय बहादुरी से लड़ाई लड़ी। उनमें से हर एक के लिए सैकड़ों दुश्मन गिरे।

सिपाही गुरमुख सिंह सिग्नलमैन थे। वे मुख्यालय को लड़ाई की रिपोर्ट देते रहे।

"हममें से पांच बचे हैं... तीन... दो..."

घंटे बीते। छोटा समूह अपनी जगह पर टिका रहा।

अंत में, केवल गुरमुख सिंह बचे। दुश्मन अंदर घुस आया था।

"दुश्मन अंदर है," उन्होंने संकेत दिया। "मैं आखिरी हूं। लड़ने की अनुमति?"

"अनुमति है," जवाब आया।

गुरमुख सिंह ने अपनी राइफल उठाई और लड़े। गिरने से पहले उन्होंने 20 और दुश्मन मारे।

21 सिखों ने सात घंटे तक 10,000 लोगों को रोके रखा!

दुश्मन को 600 से अधिक मौतें और 1,000 घायल हुए - केवल 21 लोगों से।

ब्रिटिश संसद ने यह कहानी सुनकर खड़े होकर सम्मान दिया।

उनके गांव के चालीस सिखों ने किले की रक्षा की थी। लेकिन हालात बहुत मुश्किल हो गए।

खाना या पानी नहीं था। सिख कष्ट झेल रहे थे।

कुछ सिखों ने उम्मीद छोड़ दी। उन्होंने एक पत्र लिखा कि वे गुरु को छोड़ रहे हैं।

जब माई भागो ने यह सुना, वे बहुत परेशान हुईं।

उन्होंने चालीस भगोड़ों को इकट्ठा किया और उन्हें शर्मिंदा किया।

"क्या तुम सिख नहीं हो? क्या तुम गुरु को दिया अपना वादा भूल गए?"

"मेरे पीछे आओ! हम वापस जाएंगे और लड़ेंगे!"

उनकी हिम्मत से प्रेरित होकर, सभी चालीस आदमी वापस आने को राजी हो गए।

यह भयानक लड़ाई थी। सभी चालीस सिख बहादुरी से लड़ते हुए शहीद हो गए।

गुरु जी प्रभावित हुए। उन्होंने भगोड़े होने का पत्र फाड़ दिया।

1708 में, गुरु गोबिंद सिंह जी उनसे मिलने आए।

"मैंने तुम्हारी शक्तियों के बारे में सुना है, माधो दास," गुरु ने कहा।

"मैं गोबिंद सिंह हूं। तुम कौन हो?"

गुरु ने उन्हें पांच तीर, एक तलवार और एक युद्ध झंडा दिया।

- जमींदारी प्रथा समाप्त की जो गरीबों का शोषण करती थी।
- हिंदुओं और मुसलमानों के साथ न्यायपूर्ण व्यवहार किया।

आठ साल तक उन्होंने शक्तिशाली मुगल साम्राज्य से लड़ाई लड़ी।

पंडितों का एक समूह गुरु तेग बहादुर जी के पास आया।

"गुरु जी, हमें बचाइए! औरंगजेब हमें मारना चाहता है।"

गुरु जी के छोटे बेटे, गोबिंद राय (बाद में गुरु गोबिंद सिंह), ने पूछा, "पिताजी, ये लोग क्यों रो रहे हैं?"

गुरु जी ने समझाया कि क्या हो रहा है।

नौ साल के गोबिंद राय ने कहा, "पिताजी, आप से महान कौन है जो इनकी रक्षा कर सके?"

गुरु जी मुस्कुराए। उन्होंने फैसला कर लिया।

उन्होंने पंडितों से कहा, "जाओ और औरंगजेब से कहो: पहले गुरु तेग बहादुर को मुसलमान बनाओ, फिर हम बनेंगे।"

गुरु जी जानते थे कि इसका मतलब मृत्यु है। लेकिन वे डरे नहीं।

वे दिल्ली गए और औरंगजेब के सामने खड़े हुए।

"इस्लाम अपनाओ," बादशाह ने कहा।

"नहीं," गुरु जी ने शांति से कहा। "हर किसी को अपना धर्म मानने का अधिकार है।"

औरंगजेब ने उन पर अत्याचार करवाए। लेकिन गुरु जी अडिग रहे।

24 नवंबर 1675 को, चांदनी चौक में उनका शीश काट दिया गया।

उन्होंने अपने प्राण दे दिए, लेकिन किसी और के धर्म की रक्षा की।

इसीलिए उन्हें "हिंद की चादर" कहा जाता है - भारत का रक्षक।`,

वे लड़ाई नहीं करते थे। उनका काम था घायलों को पानी पिलाना।

एक बार, आनंदपुर साहिब में भयंकर युद्ध हो रहा था।

सिख एक ओर थे और मुगल सेना दूसरी ओर।

भाई कन्हैया अपनी मशक (पानी का थैला) लेकर युद्ध के मैदान में जाते।

वे घायल सिख सैनिकों को पानी पिलाते।

लेकिन कुछ सिखों ने देखा कि भाई कन्हैया दुश्मन सैनिकों को भी पानी दे रहे हैं!

वे बहुत नाराज हुए। उन्होंने गुरु जी से शिकायत की।

"गुरु जी, भाई कन्हैया हमारे दुश्मनों की मदद कर रहे हैं!"

गुरु जी ने भाई कन्हैया को बुलाया।

"क्या यह सच है? तुम दुश्मनों को पानी देते हो?"

भाई कन्हैया ने नम्रता से कहा, "गुरु जी, मुझे कोई दुश्मन नहीं दिखता।"

"मुझे हर घायल व्यक्ति में आपका चेहरा दिखता है।"

"जब कोई प्यासा है और पीड़ा में है, तो वह सिख है या मुगल, इससे क्या फर्क?"

गुरु जी बहुत प्रसन्न हुए। उनकी आंखों में आंसू आ गए।

"तुमने सच्ची सिखी समझी है, भाई कन्हैया।"

गुरु जी ने उन्हें मलहम और पट्टियां भी दीं।

"अब से, तुम न केवल पानी दोगे, बल्कि घावों पर मरहम भी लगाओगे।"

भाई कन्हैया की यह सेवा भावना आज भी जीवित है।

बाबा अजीत सिंह 18 वर्ष के थे, बाबा जुझार सिंह 14 के, बाबा जोरावर सिंह 9 के, और बाबा फतेह सिंह केवल 6 वर्ष के थे।

मुगल बादशाह सिखों को नष्ट करना चाहता था। उसकी सेना ने आनंदपुर साहिब के किले पर हमला किया।

सिखों ने बहादुरी से लड़ाई लड़ी, लेकिन वे घिरे हुए थे। गुरु और उनके परिवार को किला छोड़ना पड़ा।

रात में बाढ़ आई सिरसा नदी पार करते समय, परिवार बिछड़ गया।

दो बड़े साहिबज़ादे - अजीत सिंह और जुझार सिंह - अपने पिता के साथ रहे।

चमकौर की लड़ाई में, उन्होंने केवल 40 सिखों के साथ विशाल मुगल सेना का सामना किया।

"पिताजी, मुझे लड़ने दीजिए," बाबा अजीत सिंह ने कहा।

"जाओ, मेरे बेटे। उन्हें सिख की ताकत दिखाओ," गुरु गोबिंद सिंह जी ने कहा।

बाबा अजीत सिंह ने शेर की तरह लड़ाई लड़ी, कई दुश्मनों को हराकर शहीद हुए।

फिर 14 वर्षीय बाबा जुझार सिंह आगे आए। "अब मेरी बारी है, पिताजी।"

उन्होंने भी अद्भुत बहादुरी से लड़ाई लड़ी और अपने भाई से मिल गए।

इस बीच, दो छोटे साहिबज़ादे अपनी दादी माता गुजरी जी के साथ थे।

एक नौकर ने पैसों के लिए उन्हें मुगलों को धोखा दे दिया।

छोटे राजकुमारों को वजीर खान, मुगल गवर्नर के सामने लाया गया।

"मुसलमान बन जाओ, और तुम राजकुमारों की तरह जीवित रहोगे," उसने प्रस्ताव दिया।

9 वर्षीय बाबा जोरावर सिंह ने उत्तर दिया, "हम गुरु गोबिंद सिंह जी के पुत्र हैं। हम कभी अपना धर्म नहीं छोड़ेंगे।"

6 वर्षीय बाबा फतेह सिंह सहमत हुए। "हम अपमान से मृत्यु चुनते हैं।"

क्रूर वजीर खान ने उन्हें जिंदा दीवार में चुनवाने का आदेश दिया।

जब दीवार उनके चारों ओर उठी, छोटे लड़के दृढ़ खड़े रहे, प्रार्थना पढ़ते रहे।

उन्होंने अपने प्राण बलिदान कर दिए लेकिन अपना धर्म नहीं छोड़ा।

जब वे 75 वर्ष के थे, भयानक समाचार आया।

अहमद शाह अब्दाली की सेना ने अमृतसर में स्वर्ण मंदिर पर हमला कर दिया था!

उन्होंने पवित्र सरोवर को कूड़े और गाय के खून से भर दिया था।

बाबा दीप सिंह जी क्रोधित हुए। "मैं अपने पवित्र स्थान को मुक्त कराऊंगा या मर जाऊंगा!"

उन्होंने सिखों की एक छोटी सेना इकट्ठी की। रास्ते में कई और जुड़ गए।

उन्होंने जमीन पर अपने भारी खंडे (तलवार) से एक रेखा खींची।

"केवल वे जो अपना जीवन देने को तैयार हैं, इस रेखा को पार करें।"

हर एक सिख ने रेखा पार की।

वे अमृतसर की ओर बढ़े, रास्ते में दुश्मनों से लड़ते हुए।

कोई भी सामान्य व्यक्ति गिर जाता। लेकिन बाबा दीप सिंह जी नहीं।

उन्हें अपना वादा याद आया: "मैं स्वर्ण मंदिर पहुंचूंगा!"

दुश्मन डर गए। उन्होंने ऐसा दृढ़ संकल्प कभी नहीं देखा था।

    content: `12 ਸਤੰਬਰ 1897 ਨੂੰ, ਪਹਾੜਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਸਾਰਾਗੜ੍ਹੀ ਨਾਮ ਦੀ ਇੱਕ ਛੋਟੀ ਚੌਕੀ ਤੇ ਕੁਝ ਅਦਭੁਤ ਹੋਇਆ।

36ਵੀਂ ਸਿੱਖ ਰੈਜੀਮੈਂਟ ਦੇ 21 ਸਿੱਖ ਸਿਪਾਹੀ ਉੱਥੇ ਤਾਇਨਾਤ ਸਨ।

ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਦੇ ਆਗੂ ਸਨ ਹਵਲਦਾਰ ਈਸ਼ਰ ਸਿੰਘ, ਇੱਕ ਬਹਾਦਰ ਤੇ ਸਮਰਪਿਤ ਵਿਅਕਤੀ।

ਇੱਕ ਸਵੇਰੇ, ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੇ ਦੂਰੋਂ ਧੂੜ ਉੱਠਦੀ ਦੇਖੀ। 10,000 ਅਫ਼ਗਾਨ ਯੋਧਿਆਂ ਦੀ ਫ਼ੌਜ ਆ ਰਹੀ ਸੀ!

ਸਿਪਾਹੀ ਜਾਣਦੇ ਸਨ ਕਿ ਉਹ ਜਿੱਤ ਨਹੀਂ ਸਕਦੇ। ਪਰ ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਦਾ ਫ਼ਰਜ਼ ਸੀ - ਸੰਚਾਰ ਚੌਕੀ ਦੀ ਰੱਖਿਆ ਕਰਨਾ।

"ਅਸੀਂ ਹਥਿਆਰ ਸੁੱਟ ਸਕਦੇ ਹਾਂ," ਕਿਸੇ ਨੇ ਕਿਹਾ।

"ਨਹੀਂ," ਹਵਲਦਾਰ ਈਸ਼ਰ ਸਿੰਘ ਨੇ ਕਿਹਾ। "ਇੱਕ ਸਿੱਖ ਕਦੇ ਹਥਿਆਰ ਨਹੀਂ ਸੁੱਟਦਾ। ਅਸੀਂ ਲੜਾਂਗੇ।"

ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੇ ਮੁੱਖ ਕਿਲ੍ਹੇ ਨੂੰ ਸੰਦੇਸ਼ ਭੇਜਿਆ: "ਸਾਡੇ ਤੇ ਹਮਲਾ ਹੋ ਰਿਹਾ ਹੈ। ਅਸੀਂ ਆਖ਼ਰੀ ਆਦਮੀ ਤੱਕ ਲੜਾਂਗੇ।"

ਲੜਾਈ ਸ਼ੁਰੂ ਹੋਈ। ਦੁਸ਼ਮਣਾਂ ਦੀ ਲਹਿਰ ਤੋਂ ਬਾਅਦ ਲਹਿਰ ਹਮਲਾ ਕਰਦੀ ਰਹੀ।

21 ਸਿੱਖਾਂ ਨੇ ਅਵਿਸ਼ਵਾਸ਼ਯੋਗ ਬਹਾਦਰੀ ਨਾਲ ਲੜਾਈ ਲੜੀ। ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਵਿੱਚੋਂ ਹਰ ਇੱਕ ਲਈ ਸੈਂਕੜੇ ਦੁਸ਼ਮਣ ਡਿੱਗੇ।

ਸਿਪਾਹੀ ਗੁਰਮੁਖ ਸਿੰਘ ਸਿਗਨਲਮੈਨ ਸਨ। ਉਹ ਮੁੱਖ ਦਫ਼ਤਰ ਨੂੰ ਲੜਾਈ ਦੀ ਰਿਪੋਰਟ ਦਿੰਦੇ ਰਹੇ।

"ਸਾਡੇ ਵਿੱਚੋਂ ਪੰਜ ਬਚੇ ਹਨ... ਤਿੰਨ... ਦੋ..."

ਘੰਟੇ ਬੀਤੇ। ਛੋਟਾ ਗਰੁੱਪ ਆਪਣੀ ਥਾਂ ਤੇ ਟਿਕਿਆ ਰਿਹਾ।

ਅੰਤ ਵਿੱਚ, ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਗੁਰਮੁਖ ਸਿੰਘ ਬਚੇ। ਦੁਸ਼ਮਣ ਅੰਦਰ ਆ ਗਿਆ ਸੀ।

"ਦੁਸ਼ਮਣ ਅੰਦਰ ਹੈ," ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੇ ਸਿਗਨਲ ਭੇਜਿਆ। "ਮੈਂ ਆਖ਼ਰੀ ਹਾਂ। ਲੜਨ ਦੀ ਇਜਾਜ਼ਤ?"

"ਇਜਾਜ਼ਤ ਹੈ," ਜਵਾਬ ਆਇਆ।

ਗੁਰਮੁਖ ਸਿੰਘ ਨੇ ਆਪਣੀ ਬੰਦੂਕ ਚੁੱਕੀ ਤੇ ਲੜੇ। ਡਿੱਗਣ ਤੋਂ ਪਹਿਲਾਂ ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੇ 20 ਹੋਰ ਦੁਸ਼ਮਣ ਮਾਰੇ।

21 ਸਿੱਖਾਂ ਨੇ ਸੱਤ ਘੰਟੇ ਤੱਕ 10,000 ਆਦਮੀਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਰੋਕੀ ਰੱਖਿਆ!

ਦੁਸ਼ਮਣ ਨੂੰ 600 ਤੋਂ ਵੱਧ ਮੌਤਾਂ ਤੇ 1,000 ਜ਼ਖ਼ਮੀ ਹੋਏ - ਸਿਰਫ਼ 21 ਲੋਕਾਂ ਤੋਂ।

ਬ੍ਰਿਟਿਸ਼ ਸੰਸਦ ਨੇ ਇਹ ਕਹਾਣੀ ਸੁਣ ਕੇ ਖੜ੍ਹੇ ਹੋ ਕੇ ਸਨਮਾਨ ਦਿੱਤਾ।

ਹਰ ਸਾਲ 12 ਸਤੰਬਰ ਨੂੰ ਇਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਬਹਾਦਰ ਯੋਧਿਆਂ ਦੇ ਸਨਮਾਨ ਵਿੱਚ ਸਾਰਾਗੜ੍ਹੀ ਦਿਵਸ ਮਨਾਇਆ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ।`,
    moral: 'ਸੱਚੀ ਬਹਾਦਰੀ ਦਾ ਮਤਲਬ ਹੈ ਆਪਣਾ ਫ਼ਰਜ਼ ਨਿਭਾਉਣਾ, ਭਾਵੇਂ ਹਾਲਾਤ ਵਿਰੁੱਧ ਹੋਣ। ਸਨਮਾਨ ਤੇ ਹਿੰਮਤ ਹਮੇਸ਼ਾ ਜਿਉਂਦੇ ਰਹਿੰਦੇ ਹਨ।',

ਬਾਬਾ ਅਜੀਤ ਸਿੰਘ 18 ਸਾਲ ਦੇ ਸਨ, ਬਾਬਾ ਜੁਝਾਰ ਸਿੰਘ 14 ਦੇ, ਬਾਬਾ ਜ਼ੋਰਾਵਰ ਸਿੰਘ 9 ਦੇ, ਤੇ ਬਾਬਾ ਫ਼ਤਿਹ ਸਿੰਘ ਸਿਰਫ਼ 6 ਸਾਲ ਦੇ ਸਨ।

ਮੁਗ਼ਲ ਬਾਦਸ਼ਾਹ ਸਿੱਖਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਖ਼ਤਮ ਕਰਨਾ ਚਾਹੁੰਦਾ ਸੀ। ਉਸਦੀ ਫ਼ੌਜ ਨੇ ਆਨੰਦਪੁਰ ਸਾਹਿਬ ਦੇ ਕਿਲ੍ਹੇ ਤੇ ਹਮਲਾ ਕੀਤਾ।

ਸਿੱਖਾਂ ਨੇ ਬਹਾਦਰੀ ਨਾਲ ਲੜਾਈ ਲੜੀ, ਪਰ ਉਹ ਘਿਰੇ ਹੋਏ ਸਨ। ਗੁਰੂ ਤੇ ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਦੇ ਪਰਿਵਾਰ ਨੂੰ ਕਿਲ੍ਹਾ ਛੱਡਣਾ ਪਿਆ।

ਰਾਤ ਨੂੰ ਹੜ੍ਹ ਆਈ ਸਿਰਸਾ ਨਦੀ ਪਾਰ ਕਰਦਿਆਂ, ਪਰਿਵਾਰ ਵਿਛੜ ਗਿਆ।

ਦੋ ਵੱਡੇ ਸਾਹਿਬਜ਼ਾਦੇ - ਅਜੀਤ ਸਿੰਘ ਤੇ ਜੁਝਾਰ ਸਿੰਘ - ਆਪਣੇ ਪਿਤਾ ਨਾਲ ਰਹੇ।

ਚਮਕੌਰ ਦੀ ਲੜਾਈ ਵਿੱਚ, ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੇ ਸਿਰਫ਼ 40 ਸਿੱਖਾਂ ਨਾਲ ਵਿਸ਼ਾਲ ਮੁਗ਼ਲ ਫ਼ੌਜ ਦਾ ਸਾਹਮਣਾ ਕੀਤਾ।

"ਪਿਤਾ ਜੀ, ਮੈਨੂੰ ਲੜਨ ਦਿਓ," ਬਾਬਾ ਅਜੀਤ ਸਿੰਘ ਨੇ ਕਿਹਾ।

"ਜਾ, ਮੇਰੇ ਪੁੱਤਰ। ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਸਿੱਖ ਦੀ ਤਾਕਤ ਦਿਖਾ," ਗੁਰੂ ਗੋਬਿੰਦ ਸਿੰਘ ਜੀ ਨੇ ਕਿਹਾ।

ਬਾਬਾ ਅਜੀਤ ਸਿੰਘ ਨੇ ਸ਼ੇਰ ਵਾਂਗ ਲੜਾਈ ਲੜੀ, ਕਈ ਦੁਸ਼ਮਣਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਹਰਾ ਕੇ ਸ਼ਹੀਦ ਹੋਏ।

ਫਿਰ 14 ਸਾਲ ਦੇ ਬਾਬਾ ਜੁਝਾਰ ਸਿੰਘ ਅੱਗੇ ਆਏ। "ਹੁਣ ਮੇਰੀ ਵਾਰੀ ਹੈ, ਪਿਤਾ ਜੀ।"

ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੇ ਵੀ ਅਦਭੁਤ ਬਹਾਦਰੀ ਨਾਲ ਲੜਾਈ ਲੜੀ ਤੇ ਆਪਣੇ ਭਰਾ ਨਾਲ ਜਾ ਮਿਲੇ।

ਇਸ ਦੌਰਾਨ, ਦੋ ਛੋਟੇ ਸਾਹਿਬਜ਼ਾਦੇ ਆਪਣੀ ਦਾਦੀ ਮਾਤਾ ਗੁਜਰੀ ਜੀ ਨਾਲ ਸਨ।

ਇੱਕ ਨੌਕਰ ਨੇ ਪੈਸਿਆਂ ਲਈ ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਮੁਗ਼ਲਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਧੋਖਾ ਦੇ ਦਿੱਤਾ।

ਛੋਟੇ ਰਾਜਕੁਮਾਰਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਵਜ਼ੀਰ ਖ਼ਾਨ, ਮੁਗ਼ਲ ਗਵਰਨਰ ਦੇ ਸਾਹਮਣੇ ਲਿਆਂਦਾ ਗਿਆ।

"ਮੁਸਲਮਾਨ ਬਣ ਜਾਓ, ਤੇ ਤੁਸੀਂ ਰਾਜਕੁਮਾਰਾਂ ਵਾਂਗ ਜਿਉਂਦੇ ਰਹੋਗੇ," ਉਸਨੇ ਪੇਸ਼ਕਸ਼ ਕੀਤੀ।

9 ਸਾਲ ਦੇ ਬਾਬਾ ਜ਼ੋਰਾਵਰ ਸਿੰਘ ਨੇ ਜਵਾਬ ਦਿੱਤਾ, "ਅਸੀਂ ਗੁਰੂ ਗੋਬਿੰਦ ਸਿੰਘ ਜੀ ਦੇ ਪੁੱਤਰ ਹਾਂ। ਅਸੀਂ ਕਦੇ ਆਪਣਾ ਧਰਮ ਨਹੀਂ ਛੱਡਾਂਗੇ।"

6 ਸਾਲ ਦੇ ਬਾਬਾ ਫ਼ਤਿਹ ਸਿੰਘ ਸਹਿਮਤ ਹੋਏ। "ਅਸੀਂ ਬੇਇੱਜ਼ਤੀ ਨਾਲੋਂ ਮੌਤ ਚੁਣਦੇ ਹਾਂ।"

ਜ਼ਾਲਮ ਵਜ਼ੀਰ ਖ਼ਾਨ ਨੇ ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਜਿਉਂਦੇ ਦੀਵਾਰ ਵਿੱਚ ਚਿਣਵਾਉਣ ਦਾ ਹੁਕਮ ਦਿੱਤਾ।

ਜਦੋਂ ਦੀਵਾਰ ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਦੇ ਚਾਰੇ ਪਾਸੇ ਉੱਠੀ, ਛੋਟੇ ਮੁੰਡੇ ਦ੍ਰਿੜ੍ਹ ਖੜ੍ਹੇ ਰਹੇ, ਪਾਠ ਪੜ੍ਹਦੇ ਰਹੇ।

ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੇ ਆਪਣੇ ਪ੍ਰਾਣ ਕੁਰਬਾਨ ਕਰ ਦਿੱਤੇ ਪਰ ਆਪਣਾ ਧਰਮ ਨਹੀਂ ਛੱਡਿਆ।

ਜਦੋਂ ਗੁਰੂ ਗੋਬਿੰਦ ਸਿੰਘ ਜੀ ਨੇ ਇਹ ਖ਼ਬਰ ਸੁਣੀ, ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੇ ਕਿਹਾ, "ਮੇਰੇ ਚਾਰ ਪੁੱਤਰ ਚਲੇ ਗਏ, ਪਰ ਲੱਖਾਂ ਸਿੱਖ ਬਚੇ ਹਨ।"`,

ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੇ ਜ਼ਮੀਨ ਤੇ ਆਪਣੇ ਭਾਰੀ ਖੰਡੇ (ਤਲਵਾਰ) ਨਾਲ ਇੱਕ ਲਕੀਰ ਖਿੱਚੀ।

"ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਉਹ ਜੋ ਆਪਣੀ ਜਾਨ ਦੇਣ ਨੂੰ ਤਿਆਰ ਹਨ, ਇਸ ਲਕੀਰ ਨੂੰ ਪਾਰ ਕਰਨ।"

ਹਰ ਇੱਕ ਸਿੱਖ ਨੇ ਲਕੀਰ ਪਾਰ ਕੀਤੀ।

ਉਹ ਅੰਮ੍ਰਿਤਸਰ ਵੱਲ ਵਧੇ, ਰਸਤੇ ਵਿੱਚ ਦੁਸ਼ਮਣਾਂ ਨਾਲ ਲੜਦੇ ਹੋਏ।

ਗੋਹਲਵਾੜ ਪਿੰਡ ਵਿੱਚ, ਅੰਮ੍ਰਿਤਸਰ ਦੇ ਨੇੜੇ, ਭਿਆਨਕ ਯੁੱਧ ਸ਼ੁਰੂ ਹੋਇਆ।

ਬਾਬਾ ਦੀਪ ਸਿੰਘ ਜੀ ਨੇ, ਆਪਣੀ ਬੁਢਾਪੇ ਦੇ ਬਾਵਜੂਦ, ਜਵਾਨ ਸ਼ੇਰ ਵਾਂਗ ਲੜਾਈ ਲੜੀ।

ਉਹ ਦੁਸ਼ਮਣ ਕਮਾਂਡਰ ਜਮਾਲ ਖ਼ਾਨ ਨਾਲ ਲੜ ਰਹੇ ਸਨ ਜਦੋਂ ਇੱਕ ਭਿਆਨਕ ਵਾਰ ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਦੀ ਧੌਣ ਤੇ ਲੱਗਾ।

ਕੋਈ ਵੀ ਆਮ ਆਦਮੀ ਡਿੱਗ ਜਾਂਦਾ। ਪਰ ਬਾਬਾ ਦੀਪ ਸਿੰਘ ਜੀ ਨਹੀਂ।

ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਆਪਣਾ ਵਾਅਦਾ ਯਾਦ ਆਇਆ: "ਮੈਂ ਸੁਨਹਿਰੇ ਮੰਦਰ ਪਹੁੰਚਾਂਗਾ!"

ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੇ ਆਪਣੇ ਖੱਬੇ ਹੱਥ ਨਾਲ ਆਪਣਾ ਸਿਰ ਫੜਿਆ ਤੇ ਸੱਜੇ ਹੱਥ ਨਾਲ ਲੜਦੇ ਰਹੇ!

"ਚੁੱਪ ਹੋ ਜਾ, ਨਹੀਂ ਤਾਂ ਹਰੀ ਸਿੰਘ ਨਲਵਾ ਆ ਜਾਵੇਗਾ!"

ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਦਾ ਨਾਮ ਹੀ ਪੰਜਾਬ ਦੇ ਦੁਸ਼ਮਣਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਡਰਾਉਣ ਲਈ ਕਾਫ਼ੀ ਸੀ।

ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੇ ਕਈ ਇਲਾਕੇ ਜਿੱਤੇ ਤੇ ਸਿੱਖ ਸਾਮਰਾਜ ਦਾ ਵਿਸਤਾਰ ਕੀਤਾ।

ਪਰ ਉਹ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਯੋਧਾ ਨਹੀਂ ਸਨ। ਉਹ ਦਿਆਲੂ ਤੇ ਨਿਰਪੱਖ ਵੀ ਸਨ।

ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੇ ਹਰ ਕਿਸੇ ਨਾਲ ਬਰਾਬਰ ਦਾ ਸਲੂਕ ਕੀਤਾ, ਭਾਵੇਂ ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਦਾ ਧਰਮ ਕੋਈ ਵੀ ਹੋਵੇ।

ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੇ ਸੜਕਾਂ, ਸਕੂਲ ਬਣਾਏ ਤੇ ਗਰੀਬਾਂ ਦੀ ਮਦਦ ਕੀਤੀ।

1837 ਵਿੱਚ, 46 ਸਾਲ ਦੀ ਉਮਰ ਵਿੱਚ, ਉਹ ਜਮਰੂਦ ਕਿਲ੍ਹੇ ਦੀ ਰੱਖਿਆ ਕਰ ਰਹੇ ਸਨ।

ਇੱਕ ਵਿਸ਼ਾਲ ਅਫ਼ਗਾਨ ਫ਼ੌਜ ਨੇ ਹਮਲਾ ਕੀਤਾ। ਹਰੀ ਸਿੰਘ ਲੜਾਈ ਵਿੱਚ ਜ਼ਖ਼ਮੀ ਹੋ ਗਏ।

ਜ਼ਖ਼ਮੀ ਹੋਣ ਦੇ ਬਾਵਜੂਦ, ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੇ ਆਪਣੇ ਸਿਪਾਹੀਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਹੁਕਮ ਦਿੱਤੇ।

"ਕਿਸੇ ਨੂੰ ਨਾ ਦੱਸੋ ਕਿ ਮੈਨੂੰ ਸੱਟ ਲੱਗੀ ਹੈ। ਲੜਦੇ ਰਹੋ!"

ਉਹ ਜਾਣਦੇ ਸਨ ਕਿ ਜੇ ਸਿਪਾਹੀਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਪਤਾ ਲੱਗਾ ਕਿ ਉਹ ਜ਼ਖ਼ਮੀ ਹਨ, ਤਾਂ ਉਹ ਉਮੀਦ ਛੱਡ ਸਕਦੇ ਹਨ।

ਸਿੱਖਾਂ ਨੇ ਲੜਾਈ ਜਿੱਤੀ, ਪਰ ਹਰੀ ਸਿੰਘ ਨਲਵਾ ਆਪਣੇ ਜ਼ਖ਼ਮਾਂ ਤੋਂ ਸ਼ਹੀਦ ਹੋ ਗਏ।

ਅਫ਼ਗਾਨਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਦੀ ਮੌਤ ਦਾ ਬਹੁਤ ਬਾਅਦ ਵਿੱਚ ਪਤਾ ਲੱਗਾ। ਉਹ ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਦੇ ਜਾਣ ਤੋਂ ਬਾਅਦ ਵੀ ਅੱਗੇ ਵਧਣ ਤੋਂ ਡਰਦੇ ਸਨ!`,
    moral: 'ਸੱਚੇ ਆਗੂ ਆਪਣੇ ਲੋਕਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਪਹਿਲਾਂ ਰੱਖਦੇ ਹਨ। ਬਹਾਦਰੀ ਨਾਲ ਦਿਆਲਤਾ ਮਿਲ ਕੇ ਮਹਾਨ ਵਿਅਕਤੀ ਬਣਾਉਂਦੀ ਹੈ।',
